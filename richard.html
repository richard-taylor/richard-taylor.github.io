<!-- challenges -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -->

<h2>May 2021</h2>

<p>Where is the time going? The last 2 months have sped by and I've not got
into my challenges at all. I don't want to fail 3 in a row. I've also not
done any timed 3x3 solves recently... and a quick average of 5 now shows I
am back in the 35-40 second range.

<p>If competitions are going to resume in the summer, then I want to get into
the 30-35 range and start pushing for sub-30 again. So, the challenge is to
do at least one average of 12 every day in May.

<h2>April 2021</h2>

<p>Some of my old electronics text books surfaced recently while I was sorting
through some boxes. I got quite nostalgic for the days when I knew more about
hardware than software. Talking to a friend about it, he mentioned that there
are some really good circuit design and simulation tools available now.

<p>I am going to investigate some tools and try to design something. Who
knows, if it goes really well I might dust off my soldering iron and build
something for real.

<p class="edit">Lots of things came up this month, so I barely got started. I
did have a look at <a href="https://kicad.org">kicad.org</a> and would love to
give it a try another time.

<h2>March 2021</h2>

<p>Reading is a skill that I don't so much forget, as forget to use. It is
easier to watch videos, but so much less rewarding in some ways.

<p>This month I am going to try and read the books I got for Christmas -
"Light" by M. John Harrison; "Hyperion" by Dan Simmons; and "Matter" by
Iain M. Banks.

<p class="edit">My first DNF. It took longer to read the first book than I
hoped, so I only got part-way through the second book. However, in the process
I did decide to re-subscribe to
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com">New Scientist</a> and get my news from
long-form print rather than doom-scrolling apps and TV.

<h2>February 2021</h2>

<p>As this is a short month I am going with something that might be at the
easier end of the spectrum.

<p>I am a big fan of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_puzzle">twisty puzzles</a>
and can solve many of them reasonably well. But one puzzle that I
have never learned to solve completely is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaminx">Megaminx</a>. It's time to
figure out how to do that last layer.

<p class="edit">There is a great tutorial from Feliks Zemdegs on his
<a href="https://www.cubeskills.com/tutorials/beginner-megaminx-tutorial">CubeSkills</a>
website which has a very good beginner method and some tips for improvements
aimed at 3x3 solvers.

<h2>January 2021</h2>

<p>How better to start off 2021 than with a good tidy up! I have a couple of
decades worth of digital files, and at least 40 years of paper documents that
I have loosely "filed" in several different locations. And I can never find
anything.

<p>But how can I fix this? I recently came across the
<a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/">Johnny.Decimal</a> system. So I am going
to learn all about it and try to apply it to my desperately unorganised
personal records.

<p class="edit">This is a great system for me. I love it.

<h2>December 2020</h2>

<p>As the year of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">covid-19 pandemic</a>
was coming to an end, I found myself reading an
<a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/how-to-get-smarter-every-day-according-to-neuroscience.html">article on fluid intelligence</a>.
It basically says "keep challenging yourself to learn new things". Which is
kind of what I have always done, until this year, when I abandoned all my
mini-projects.

<p>So how about learning, or relearning, one new thing each month? To start
off I went back to a game I used to play a long time ago - chess. It's very
popular at the moment (thanks to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(miniseries)">The Queen's Gambit</a>)
and I'm not expecting to master the game... I am just going to try solving
chess puzzles on <a href="https://lichess.org">lichess</a> every day.

<p class="edit">Let's see if I can keep the challenges going in 2021.
