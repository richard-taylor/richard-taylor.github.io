<h2>January 2021</h2>

<p>How better to start off 2021 than with a good tidy up! I have a couple of
decades worth of digital files, and at least 40 years of paper documents that
I have loosely "filed" in several different locations. And I can never find
anything.

<p>But how can I fix this? I recently came across the
<a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/">Johnny.Decimal</a> system. So I am going
to learn all about it and try to apply it to my desperately unorganised
personal records.

<h2>December 2020</h2>

<p>As the year of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">covid-19 pandemic</a>
was coming to an end, I found myself reading an
<a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/how-to-get-smarter-every-day-according-to-neuroscience.html">article on fluid intelligence</a>.
It basically says "keep challenging yourself to learn new things". Which is
kind of what I have always done, until this year, when I abandoned all my
mini-projects.

<p>So how about learning, or relearning, one new thing each month? To start
off I went back to a game I used to play a long time ago - chess. It's very
popular at the moment (thanks to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(miniseries)">The Queen's Gambit</a>)
and I'm not expecting to master the game... I am just going to try solving
chess puzzles on <a href="https://lichess.org">lichess</a> every day.
