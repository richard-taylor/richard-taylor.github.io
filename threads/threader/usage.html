<h1 class="title">Threader Usage</h1>

<p>When you run the threader in a top-level directory it looks for
sub-directories that appear to be threads. Then it processes each thread and
adds them all to a top-level index.

<p>There are just 3 requirements to make a directory appear in the threader
index.

<ol>
<li>A <code>thread.json</code> file in the directory
<li>A file that has a <code>title</code> in the <code>head</code> element
<li>A <code>meta</code> element with the creation date of the article
</ol>

<p>Lets look at each of those.

<h2>1. Config file</h2>

<p>A thread is configured with a simple JSON file like this:

<pre><code class="json">{
  "name": "Article Threader",
  "description": "A python module to link sequences of articles into threads."
}
</code></pre>

<p>The "name" and "description" fields are used in the index. Easy.

<h2>2. Title</h2>

<p>The title is used in the index and also in the "previous" and "next" links
described below. Because I usually have an <code>h1</code> element that also
contains the title, this can also be automaticaly populated by the threader.
Just add the class "title".

<pre><code class="html">&lt;h1 class="title"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>

<h2>3. Creation Date</h2>

<p>The threader uses the creation date to determine the ordering of articles
in a thread. There is no standard for specifying this, but a common approach
is to use a <code>meta</code> element like this:

<pre><code class="html">&lt;meta name="date.created" content="2019-01-27"&gt;</code></pre>

As with the title I usually want to include the date in the article itself. To
avoid repeating yourself you can add the class "date_created" to a
<code>span</code> element and the date will be inserted automatically.

<pre><code class="html">&lt;span class="date_created"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<h2>4. Previous and Next</h2>

<p>As I said above, there are only 3 requirements for a thread article, so this
part is optional. Without it you can still have threaded articles and an index.

<p>If you want to have links in an article to the immediately preceeding and/or
following articles in the series then you can do that with a <code>span</code>
element that has either the "previous_article" or the "next_article" class.

<pre><code class="html">&lt;span class="previous_article"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="next_article"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The threader will insert anchor elements into these spans which point to
the right article and have the article's title as the anchor text. For the
first and last article in a series there is obviously no link to insert so
the text "This is the first article" or "This is the latest article" is used
instead.

<p>So if you change the title of an article (in the <code>head</code> element)
then all you have to do is re-run the threader and all the links will be updated
in all the neighbouring pages.
