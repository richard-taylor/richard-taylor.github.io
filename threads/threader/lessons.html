<h1 class="title">Lessons Learned</h1>

<p>In no particular order.

<ul>

<li>Resist the urge to over-engineer

<p>Even though I knew I only wanted a few features from this program, it was
hard to not design and implement it as if I might need to extend it massively
in the future.

<p>That's what you get from years of working on code that needed extending
but was not extendable.

<p>So many of my personal projects never get finished because they never get
complete enough to be useful... whilst potentially being very extendable.

<p>To force myself to keep the design compact I decided to put all the classes
into a single file. That way my desire to keep the file small enough to read
offset my desire to abstract things too much.

<li>Unit tests always pay for themselves

<p>Not a lesson I learned here for the first time, but worth repeating over and
over again. Even a small piece of code like this benefits from having unit
tests. And if I do need to extend and refactor in future, or even just
remember how this is supposed to work, it will be so much easier.

<p>Part of the not over-engineering was a decision to use regexes rather
than a full HTML parser to extract and insert into documents. That is easier
to justify (to yourself at least) if you have tests that show the cases you
have covered.

<li>Write some docs for yourself

<p>I knocked up this documentation as a demo of the code I was writing. But
actually on reflection I found it really useful to clarify what I had done and
why. I think even if I had never published it to the web it would still have
been worth writing.

<p>Often I just make notes in a text file alongside the code. But I think in
future I will write something a bit more substantial, even if just for myself.
