<h1 class="title">Introduction to Threader</h1>

<p>Having spent a lot of time playing with different blogging sites and
self-hosted tools, I decided that none of them did what I want.

<p>Basically because I don't want the tool to do very much. Linking pages
together "in order" and creating an index. That is about it. HTML is fine as a
format for me. I don't want to learn a new markup or markdown language. I don't
want to struggle through countless menus to find the command to centre a column
in a table.

<p>Of course, I may be in a tiny minority here. People may say "writing raw
HTML in the 2010s is like writing machine code in the 2000s" ... and actually
I did write some machine code in the 2000s too :-)

<p>Anyway, take it or leave it, the
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/richard-taylor.github.io/tree/master/threads/threader">
code is on github
</a> for anyone that is curious about why this website looks weird.

<p>And whilst it does not really need much documentation, this thread is here
as a test ground for trying out the code. Which is why I have split it into
several pages rather than putting it all onto one as I would otherwise have
done.
