<h1 class="title">FMC and Block Building</h1>

<p>Fewest Moves Challenge (FMC for short) is an
<a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-E-fewest-moves">official WCA event</a>
where the objective is to solve a 3x3x3 cube in the most efficient way. Speed
is not an issue, other than an over all time limit of one hour.

<p>The first rule of FMC is "There is no best method for FMC". You have to
try a lot of different techniques and use your experience and intuition to
pursue the directions that look most promising for the scramble at hand.

<p>Having said that, there are numerous techniques that you can assemble
into a toolkit for FMC attempts. One such technique is Block Building.

<h2>Block Building</h2>

<p>What is a block? It is just a collection of adjacent pieces that are
positioned and oriented correctly relative to each other.

<p>This picture shows the smallest block, a single corner and edge piece
joined together. As the whole cube is a 3x3x3 then this block is 2x1x1.

</figure>

<p>There is another way to get a 2x1x1 block and that is to join a centre piece
with an edge. If you can join both these types of block together then you get
a 2x2x1 block.

</figure>

<p>Notice that the four pieces in this block are only solved correctly on the
white face. To extend to a 2x2x2 block we need another edge and two centres.

<p>How many moves should it take to get this far? I have developed some
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/rubik">software tools on github</a>
that can help. Lets take a standard WCA scramble and test it.

<pre><code class="bash"># bin/block222 "L F2 B2 U' B2 L D L2 F' L2 F2 U2 D2 R2 D2 L2 F' U2 F2 R' B"
INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.962193 seconds.
Solutions:
    B' R' U B L'
    U' R' D2 R2 B2
    U L' B' R' B
    R2 B2 U2 F D
</code></pre>

<p>For this scramble the shortest "algorithm" to get a 2x2x2 block is 5 moves;
and there are 4 different ways to do it.
