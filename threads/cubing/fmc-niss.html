<h1 class="title">Inverse Scramble and NISS</h1>

<p>by <a href="../contact.html">Richard Taylor</a>
    : <span class="date_created">2019-02-23</span>

<p>When people talk about "the inverse scramble" for FMC they mean the
trivial inverse of the scramble. This is what you get when you reverse
the order of the scramble and invert each of the individual turns.

<pre><code class="math">inverse( R U' F ) = F' U R'</code></pre>

<p>You can see how this is an inverse if you write the inverse after the
scramble and group moves together from the middle outwards. Each pair of
moves cancels, leaving the identity, which is an "algorithm" that has no
effect.

<pre><code class="math">(R (U' (F F') U) R') = 1</code></pre>

<p>Usually the identity is written as a capital "I" but that may be a bit
confusing in an article about "Inverse Scramble" so I will use the number
"1" as an alternative for the identity. This comes from thinking of algorithms
as multiplying each other, so 1 is the number that does not change anything.

<pre><code class="math">R 1 = 1 R = R</code></pre>

<p>There are obviously other inverses of the scramble. Those are what we
call solutions and what we are looking to find.

<p>The purist in me thinks that using the Inverse Scramble is against the
spirit of FMC. In an ideal world you wouldn't get to see the scramble at all,
you would just get a scrambled cube to solve. But that would not be a very
practical event - you would either have to be very careful to write down every
move you made - or have lots of cubes scrambled the same way - or have
"floating scramblers" who could rescramble cubes on demand using the "secret"
scramble.

<p>So, on balance, the solvers need to have the scramble. And the pragmatist
in me thinks that you play the game as well as the rules allow. If the
inverse scramble can give you a better result than the "normal" scramble,
then why not use it.

<h2>Inverse Scramble</h2>

<p>How can the inverse scramble help us solve the normal scramble? Well, if
the inverse scramble is <span class="alg">S'</span> and we find a sequence
of moves <span class="alg">A</span> that solves it, then we know:

<pre><code class="math">S' A = 1</code></pre>

<p>Applying the same moves before and after each side of the equation,

<pre><code class="math">S (S' A) A' = S (1) A'</code></pre>

<p>Gives

<pre><code class="math">1 = S A'</code></pre>

<p>So if <span class="alg">A</span> is a solution to the inverse scramble, then
<span class="alg">A'</span> is a solution to the normal scramble.

<p>And why would we want to use the inverse scramble? Well, it might just be
easier to work with using the techniques we know. For example,

<pre><code class="bash"># SCRAMBLE=\
"L2 D' B2 U2 F2 R2 D R2 U' B2 L U' B2 R' U2 R' D B U R"

# bin/block222 "${SCRAMBLE}"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.149369 seconds.

Solutions:
    B' L U2 B2 R
    B L2 F2 L2 D2
    B L F2 L' D2
    D2 L' R' D' R
    L2 F2 L2 B D2
    L F2 L' B D2
</code></pre>

<p>The shortest 2x2x2 block on the normal scramble is 5 moves.

<pre><code class="bash"># INVERSE=\
"R' U' B' D' R U2 R B2 U L' B2 U R2 D' R2 F2 U2 B2 D L2"

# bin/block222 "${INVERSE}"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.015249 seconds.

Solutions:
    R U F2 L
</code></pre>

<p>But on the inverse scramble there is a 4 move 2x2x2 block.

<p>You do not have to type in the <code>INVERSE</code> explicitly. There is
a <code>--inverse</code> option that will use the inverse of the scramble on
the command line.

<pre><code class="bash"># bin/block222 --inverse "${SCRAMBLE}"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.015249 seconds.

Solutions:
    (R U F2 L)    L' F2 U' R'
</code></pre>

<p>Note that with the <code>--inverse</code> option both the solution and
its inverse are printed out. That is because you need to put the inverse
at the front of the scramble if you want to do more work. Because the
inverse is the normal scramble but backwards. So to build a 3x2x2 on this
block using the inverse you would need to use,

<pre><code class="bash"># bin/block322 --inverse "L' F2 U' R' ${SCRAMBLE}"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.140285 seconds.

Solutions:
    (R' U' R2 B' R)    R' B R2 U R
    (L U L' B2 U2)     U2 B2 L U' L'
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas if you had typed out the inverse you would put moves on the end
instead,

<pre><code class="bash"># bin/block322 "${INVERSE} R U F2 L"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.140285 seconds.

Solutions:
    R' U' R2 B' R
    L U L' B2 U2
</code></pre>

<p>We will see why the first method is useful in the next section on NISS.

<h2>Normal Inverse Scramble Switch</h2>

<p>Using the inverse scramble as a simple alternative to the normal scramble,
just because it might be easier, is fairly straightforward to understand.

<p>The real power of the inverse comes when you combine it with the
normal scramble to do NISS - Normal, Inverse, Scramble Switch.

<p>At first read this can seem like magic, so lets take a careful look
at some background first. Here is a cube that has been scrambled and
then a 2x2x2 block solved.

<figure class="medium">
  <img src="pics/niss-normal.png" alt="Normal Block">
  <figcaption>Normal Block</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Lets call <span class="alg">A</span> the set of moves that are the
scramble plus the block solution.

<p>What is the effect of <span class="alg">A</span> on the pieces that
make up the 2x2x2 block? Well, in the solved cube at the start the pieces
are solved, and after <span class="alg">A</span> the pieces are also solved.
So as far as those pieces are concerned <span class="alg">A</span> is the
identity.

<p>Since the inverse of the identity is also the identity, if we apply the
inverse of <span class="alg">A</span> to a solved cube then it will also
create a 2x2x2 block.

<figure class="medium">
  <img src="pics/niss-inverse.png" alt="Inverse Block">
  <figcaption>Inverse Block</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notice that the other pieces not on the 2x2x2 block are different. That
is because for them <span class="alg">A</span> and <span class="alg">A'</span>
do not have the same effect, because they are not the identity.

<p>This gives us a powerful trick. We can take any partial solution
<span class="alg">A</span> and invert it, then apply it to a solved cube
and we will get something that has the same solved pieces, but different
(and hopefully better) unsolved pieces.

<h3>Loops Not Lines</h3>

<p>At this point it is worth noting that we should not think of a scramble
and the solution as being a right-to-left process, because both ends are
the same thing... so it is more like this,

<figure class="medium">
  <img src="pics/niss-1.png" alt="NISS normal loop">
  <figcaption>Scramble Solution Loop</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And since the inverse scramble is the normal scramble "backwards" then you
can think of solving the inverse as going round the loop in the opposite
direction, like this,

<figure class="medium">
  <img src="pics/niss-2.png" alt="NISS inverse loop">
  <figcaption>Inverse Solution Loop</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then, given that we know we can solve a few pieces, invert the solution
and go back through the scramble in the opposite direction, and still have
the same pieces solved: we can do something like this,

<figure class="medium">
  <img src="pics/niss-3.png" alt="NISS horseshoe">
  <figcaption>Normal Inverse Solution Loop</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is the <em>Normal Inverse Scramble Switch</em>. We solve a few pieces
going one way, switch, solve a few pieces going the other way, switch, solve
more pieces the other way and so on.

<p>If we switch backwards and forwards between the normal and inverse
scramble and eventually get to a solution, by closing the loop, then we will
have something like this,

<pre><code class="math">P S Q = 1
</code></pre>

Where <span class="alg">P</span> is the inverse of the set of moves we have
applied in the inverse direction and <span class="alg">Q</span> is the set of
moves we have applied in the normal direction.

<p>Does that help us with a solution to <span class="alg">S</span>?

<p>Let's do a bit of manipulation, adding the same moves before and after each
side of the equation,

<pre><code class="math">P' (P S Q) P = P' (1) P</code></pre>

<pre><code class="math">S Q P = 1</code></pre>

<pre><code class="math">Q P = S'</code></pre>

<p>Great. So we can simply move the sequence <span class="alg">P</span> from
the front to the back and then <span class="alg">Q&nbsp;P</span> is a solution
to the normal scramble!

<p>Note that we can <em>only</em> do this when we have closed the loop and
found a solution. You cannot put the two partial solutions together with an
open loop; it just does not work.

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let's see how this can work in practise. First a straight solution without
using the inverse at all:

<pre><code class="bash"># SCRAMBLE=\
"F2 L' D2 R U2 R' U2 B2 F2 L D2 R2 U L2 F U2 L2 D2 L' D2 L'"

# bin/block222 "${SCRAMBLE}"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.152917 seconds.

Solutions:
    F B2 R' D B

# bin/block322 "${SCRAMBLE} F B2 R' D B"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.139395 seconds.

Solutions:
    F2 D2 L' F2 L'

# bin/f2L-1 "${SCRAMBLE}  F B2 R' D B  F2 D2 L' F2 L'"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 6 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 7 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 25.6085 seconds.
Solutions:
    D' F2 R' D' R2 F R'
    D F' D2 L D L' D'
    D F2 D2 F2 R F' R'
    R F R2 D2 R F' D2
</code></pre>

<p>That's 17 moves to F2L-1.

<p>Now lets try the inverse to get a different 2x2x2.

<pre><code class="bash"># bin/block222 --inverse "${SCRAMBLE}"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.150026 seconds.

Solutions:
    (R' D2 F2 U L2)    L2 U' F2 D2 R
    (L' B2 U L U')     U L' U' B2 L
</code></pre>

<p>Then switch to normal for a 3x2x2 block.

<pre><code class="bash"># bin/block322 "U L' U' B2 L ${SCRAMBLE}"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 0.144626 seconds.

Solutions:
    D R2 D' R' D2
    U' R D2 R' U
    R' F' R2 F D2
</code></pre>

<p>And stick with normal for F2L-1.

<pre><code class="bash"># bin/f2L-1 "U L' U' B2 L ${SCRAMBLE} D R2 D' R' D2"

INFO: Looking for a solution with 1 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 2 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 3 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 4 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 5 turns.
INFO: Looking for a solution with 6 turns.
INFO: Solving time: 1.8515 seconds.

Solutions:
    U' B2 U R B R2
</code></pre>

<p>Which is only 16 moves to F2L-1.

<p>If we can finish off with some more moves <span class="alg">Q</span> then
our final solution would be

<pre><code class="math">D R2 D' R' D2
U' B2 U R B R2
Q
U L' U' B2 L
</code></pre>

<p>NISS is not a silver bullet. Sometimes it will help, sometimes it wont.
In this case it seems to help a bit.

<h3>NISS Notation</h3>

<p>Let's look at Harry Savage's annotated 17 move WR single, which used NISS.

<pre><code class="bash">Scramble: R' U' F D' L2 B2 R2 B2 U F2 D U F2 R2 F D
          R2 B L D' B2 R' D' F2 R' U' F

R L' D' L    // eo [4/17]
(R2 F')      // DR [2/17]
U' R2 D'     // 2x2 + sq [3/17]
L2 D' L2 D   // EO on all axes + sq[4/17]
F2 U2 F2 L2  // finish [4/17]

Solution: R L' D' L U' R2 D' L2 D' L2 D F2 U2 F2 L2 F R2 [17]
</code></pre>

<p>It is that second line <span class="alg">(R2 F')</span> which is the switch,
as indicated by the braces <span class="alg">()</span> around the moves.

<p>The way to read this is as follows, writing the original scramble as
<span class="alg">S</span>,

<ol>
<li>Scramble with <span class="alg">S</span>
<li>Apply the moves <span class="alg">R L' D' L</span>
<li>Switch to inverse
<li>Scramble with <span class="alg">L' D L R' S'</span>
<li>Apply the moves <span class="alg">R2 F'</span>
<li>Switch to normal
<li>Scramble with <span class="alg">F R2 S R L' D' L</span>
<li>Apply the moves <span class="alg">U' R2 D'</span>
<li>Apply the moves <span class="alg">L2 D' L2 D</span>
<li>Apply the moves <span class="alg">F2 U2 F2 L2</span>
</ol>

<p>The cube was scrambled and solved by the sequence:

<pre><code class="math">F R2
S
R L' D' L U' R2 D' L2 D' L2 D F2 U2 F2 L2
</code></pre>

<p>So we can now drag the moves from before the scramble to the end to get the
final solution:

<pre><code class="math">R L' D' L U' R2 D' L2 D' L2 D F2 U2 F2 L2
F R2
</code></pre>

<p>I think the braces <span class="alg">()</span> notation is a nice compact
way of writing down a solution that incorporates NISS. It seems to have been
first proposed on <a href="https://fmcsolves.cubing.net/?p=53">FMC Solves</a>.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>As with all FMC techniques the more you try the more likely you are to hit
upon a good solution. So using the inverse scramble, and NISS, is certainly
something worth knowing about. And it is not as complicated as it might first
seem: if you just think of it as tackling the scramble from both ends.
