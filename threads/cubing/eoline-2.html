<h1 class="title">EOLine for Intermediates - Part 2</h1>

<p>by <a href="../contact.html">Richard Taylor</a>
    : <span class="date_created">2022-01-28</span>

<p>In the previous article I shared some tools for helping ZZ solvers move
towards optimal EOLine solutions. But that is potentially a long road. Are
there any stops on the way? I found a few things that might help.

<h2>Green-Blue Neutrality</h2>

<p>One thing that leaps out quite quickly is that unless you are prepared to
spin the cube 180 degrees after EOLine, in about half your solves, then you
need to be able to solve with <em>either</em> green on front <em>or</em> blue
on front.

<p>If you are always unconsciously trying to find an EOLine that works with
green on the front then you are really limiting yourself.

<p>A flip side of this is that you shouldn't worry too much about placing the
two line edges in their exact places during EOLine; focus on getting them in
<em>opposite</em> slots on the bottom face. As long as they are then you can
place them correctly with <span class="alg">D</span>, <span
class="alg">D2</span> or <span class="alg">D'</span>.

<p>For example, if you already have 4 bad edges on the green face like
this:

<figure class="small">
  <img src="pics/eoline-4-2.jpg" alt="4 bad edges remaining">
  <figcaption>Opposite line edge</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>That is already a great position, as you can fix those edges and place the
blue-white edge on the line with an <span class="alg">F</span> turn. Then you
can put the green-white opposite and finish with <span class="alg">D2</span>.
Alternatively, once you are green-blue neutral, then you can also finish with
<span class="alg">Uw2</span> if that gives a better transition into F2L.

<h2>EO and Line not EO then Line</h2>

<p>This is said in most tutorials but it didn't fully sink in for me. I guess
if you start off solving EO first and then thinking about the line, then it is
hard to break out of that mental model of always doing the line at the end.

<p>But looking at optimal solutions it is clear that placing a line edge early
in the EOLine is often a good idea. In particular if a line edge is bad, then
placing it at the same time as fixing its orientation is ideal. Given that you
expect at least one of the line edges to be bad in 75% of scrambles, that is
something to always bear in mind. You are never going to get better at most
EOLine cases if you always leave consideration of the line to the end.

<p>Look again at the 6-bad edge scramble from the previous article:

<pre><code class="math">R U L R U L F2 U B' L U2 F D
</code></pre>

<p>Both of the line edges are bad, and the optimal EOLine is 7 moves. What
happens if we just concentrate on fixing and placing the green-white edge
first?

<pre><code class="math">D U' R' U F
</code></pre>

<p>Does the trick. And we are left with <span class="alg">B R B'</span> to fix
and place the blue-white edge. That's 8 moves, which is only one turn more than
the optimal solution.

<p>Also, imagine that you only manage to plan those first 5 moves during
inspection.  If you execute them <em>on the back</em> using:

<pre><code class="math">y2 D U' L' U B
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you do the original moves on the front and then turn the cube round
(<span class="alg">y2</span>) then you know there are 2 bad edges left,
including the blue-white line piece. So you should quickly spot them and know
to finish with:

<pre><code class="math">F L F'
</code></pre>

<p>This insight helped me build some back-up tactics for when I couldn't plan
my whole EOLine in the 15 seconds of inspection. My observation is that if you
only get part of the process done in 15 seconds, then it is better to orient
some of the edges and place a line piece, than to orient most of the edges but
leave the line pieces in limbo. The remaining sections in this article look at
some common specific cases.

<h2>6 bad with one line bad</h2>

<p>The most likely number of bad edges in a scramble is 6 and there is a 50/50
chance that each of the line edges are bad. So the most likely scenario is that
you will see 6 bad edges with one of them being a line edge.

<p>If you can orient 4 edges, including the bad line edge, and place that line
edge during inspection, then you will be left with 2 bad edges, neither of
which will be a line edge.

<figure class="small">
  <img src="pics/eoline-4-1.jpg" alt="4 bad edges remaining">
  <figcaption>4 edges including line</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Typically that means putting 4 bad edges on the back face, with the bad line
edge in one of the "equator" positions (BL or BR) and executing <span
class="alg">B</span> or <span class="alg">B'</span> to place the line edge.

<p>If you do that and are lucky enough to also have the other line edge in
the right place then you will see something like this:

<figure class="small">
  <img src="pics/eoline-6-1.jpg" alt="2 bad edges remaining">
  <figcaption>2 edges remaining = F' U' F</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Which solves with <span class="alg">F' U' F</span>. Or this:

<figure class="small">
  <img src="pics/eoline-6-2.jpg" alt="2 bad edges remaining">
  <figcaption>2 edges remaining = F' L F</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Which solves with <span class="alg">F' L F</span>. You will find that
these combinations quickly become intuitive, like F2L inserts.

<p>It is more likely that your remaining line edge will not be in the
right place. If it isn't, then move it to the FU slot like this:

<figure class="small">
  <img src="pics/eoline-6-4.jpg" alt="2 bad edges remaining">
  <figcaption>2 edges remaining = F U' F</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then you can orient the edges and place the line piece with
<span class="alg">F U' F</span>. Or you may find the other bad edge
is opposite the line edge (in the DF slot) like this:

<figure class="small">
  <img src="pics/eoline-6-3.jpg" alt="2 bad edges remaining">
  <figcaption>2 edges remaining = F L F</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Which solves with <span class="alg">F L F</span>.

<p>Obviously the edges can be in other positions, but they will either be a
symmetry of one of these or a position that can be moved into one of these
configurations with one or two additional turns.

<h2>6 bad with both lines bad</h2>

<p>In about 25% of scrambles with 6 bad edges you will find both of the
line edges are bad. If you fix 4 edges including one of the line pieces
and place that line piece, then you will be left with 2 bad edges, one
of which is the other line piece.

<p>That means you only have 2 pieces to look for and there are fewer different
ways to finish off. Basically you need to get the line piece into one of the
four slots UL, UR, DL, DR and the other edge into UF or DF. Then there is a 3
move finish.

<p>Here is the line in UL and the edge in UF:

<figure class="small">
  <img src="pics/eoline-6-5.jpg" alt="2 bad edges remaining">
  <figcaption>line + edge = F' L F'</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And here is the line in DL and the edge in DF:

<figure class="small">
  <img src="pics/eoline-6-6.jpg" alt="2 bad edges remaining">
  <figcaption>line + edge = F L' F'</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All 8 combinations of those slots work, but obviously the ones with edges on
the bottom are harder to spot. You can do <span class="alg">L2</span> or <span
class="alg">R2</span> rather than rotating the cube if that also helps with the
transition to F2L.

<h2>6 bad with neither line bad</h2>

<p>The remaining 25% of 6 bad edge scrambles will have neither of the line
edges badly oriented. You could orient 4 edges, place a line edge and then use
the finishes from the "6 bad with one line bad" section above. But I find that
a bit clunky. Usually if both line edges are correctly oriented then I find
that those are the cases where it <em>does</em> make sense to fix the
orientations of the other edges first and then place the line pieces at the
end.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Getting lots of +2s and DNFs because you can't plan EOLine in 15 seconds
will quickly sap your enthusiasm for the ZZ method as you try to improve.
My two main observations that might help you are:
<ol>
<li>Becoming green-blue neutral is worth the effort
<li>Placing at least one line edge early is often key
</ol>

<p>Don't give up on finding optimal, or near optimal, EOLine solutions.
It does get easier, or at least more intuitive, the more you practise.
Hopefully the tips here will show you that you can bridge the gap between
intermediate and expert by executing a partial EOLine and then finishing
the job with a few simple triggers if you have to - a bit like an extra
F2L pair.
