<h1 class="title">Advanced EOLine - Part 1</h1>

<p>In the previous article I shared some tools for helping ZZ solvers move
towards optimal EOLine solutions. Once you have mastered that, what else is
there to learn?

<h2>Green-Blue and Red-Orange Neutrality</h2>

<p>Unlike CFOP, where many solvers learn to make the cross on any of the
6 faces (colour neutrality), the prospect of making a line on any
face and orienting all 12 edges seems very, very difficult.

<p>But it seems intuitive that if the line on white looks tricky with green or
blue on front, then it <em>might</em> be easier to make a line at 90 degrees
to that instead (line on white but edges oriented with red or orange on front).

<p>So let's look at some numbers. I did a billion random scrambles and counted
the "bad" edges on the z-axis (green-blue) and also on the x-axis (red-orange).
I found that the proportion of scrambles where the x-axis count was less than
the z-axis count was 0.329 and where it was less or equal was 0.671.

<p>Just in terms of the number of bad edges then, you have a 32.9% chance of
doing better by switching from Z to X, and a 67.1% chance of not doing worse.

<p>Since you can do "better" if you are able to solve on <em>either</em>
green-blue or red-orange 32.9% of the time, that means the chance of doing
better on at least one solve in a round of 5 is 86.4%, which is huge. So it
definitely seems worth the trouble. Obviously the number of bad edges alone
doesn't paint the whole picture, but quantifying the "niceness" of the line
edges will have to wait for further analysis. 

<p>If we are convinced that there is value in learning to solve EOLine on two
different axes, let's look at some more detail. On those billion scrambles
these are the proportions of "bad" edges on the x-axis for each of the possible
counts on the z-axis.

<pre>
Z edges  X0      X2      X4      X6      X8      X10     X12
===============================================================
0        0.0019  0.0650  0.3389  0.4531  0.1414  0.0000  0.0000
2        0.0010  0.0524  0.3115  0.4508  0.1714  0.0129  0.0000
4        0.0007  0.0415  0.2782  0.4507  0.2057  0.0229  0.0003
6        0.0005  0.0322  0.2415  0.4517  0.2414  0.0322  0.0005
8        0.0003  0.0229  0.2057  0.4507  0.2783  0.0415  0.0007
10       0.0000  0.0129  0.1716  0.4507  0.3114  0.0525  0.0010
12       0.0000  0.0000  0.1405  0.4527  0.3396  0.0652  0.0020
</pre>

<p>Clearly you are unlikely to get fewer than 4 bad edges on red-orange if
there are 12 on blue-green, but also you are unlikely to get more than 8. Here
are the chances of doing the same or better given a particular "bad" edge count
on one axis.

<pre>
Z    Better or same
===================
0    0.0019
2    0.0534
4    0.3204
6    0.7259
8    0.9578
10   0.9990
12   1
</pre>

<p>And of doing strictly better.

<pre>
Z    Better
===========
2    0.0010
4    0.0422
6    0.2741
8    0.6795
10   0.9466
12   0.9980
</pre>

<p>So it looks like you are unlikely to do better on the second axis if there
are 6 or fewer "bad" edges on the first axis. But you are also unlikely to do
worse if there are 6, so it might be worth considering if the line edges are
awkward. Also on the positive side, if there are 10 or more "bad" edges on the
first axis then you are almost certain to do better on the second axis.

<p>Is it only slightly better though? Swapping a 12 for a 10 isn't a particularly
fantastic trade. Here are the chances of doing better by 4 and 6 edges, rather
than just the minimum of 2.

<pre>
Z    Better by 4    Better by 6
===============================
0    0              0
2    0              0
4    0.0007         0
6    0.0327         0.0005
8    0.2288         0.0231
10   0.6352         0.1845
12   0.9327         0.5931
</pre>

<p>So it is good news. There is a 59.3% chance that the second axis will have
6 or fewer "bad" edges if the first axis has 12. And a 63.5% chance of 6
or fewer if the first has 10.  Those are significant chances of improvement.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Always solving EOLine with white on bottom and green or blue on front will
get you a long way. Most of the time you will get 4, 6 or 8 edge cases and
you know how to plan those effectively. But if you get unlucky and get a
couple of 10 edge cases then it can kill your average.

<p>Being able to solve EOLine with red or orange on front <em>as well</em>
could save the day in this situation. There is almost a 95% chance that
red-orange will have 8 or fewer "bad" edges if blue-green has 10; and more
than 63% chance that there will be 6 or fewer. 

<p>"There's no such thing as a free lunch" they say. And the cost is that
learning a second axis is hard. As if learning one wasn't hard enough. I
am just starting this process... some days it goes well, some days it seems
impossible. I'll write a follow up if I make it out the other side!
