<h1 class="title">Introduction to Cubing</h1>

<p>Solving a Rubik's Cube as fast as possible is a very popular passtime. In
2017 a thousand competitors from around the globe met at the World Championship
in Paris. The standard was very high, with the top 98 competitors all
completing their 5 first-round solves in an average time of under 10 seconds.

<p>The biggest cheer of the event was reserved for Ern&#337; Rubik, the
inventor of the 3x3x3 cube, who presented some awards and gave a rousing
speech.

<p>But you don't have to be super-fast to compete. The
<a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/">cubing community</a> is
very friendly, and even lets people as slow as me take part.

<p>I am never going to win any prizes for speed, but I do have an enduring
fascination for this puzzle, which I first solved in the 1980s.

<p>One particular event that I have recently become more interested in
is the Fewest Moves Challenge (FMC). Where the objective is to solve the
cube most efficiently (in one hour) rather than quickly.

<p>To help me practise I am developing some
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/rubik">software tools on github</a>.
And these will be the subject of most of the articles in this thread.
