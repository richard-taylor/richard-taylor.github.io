<h1 class="title">Links and Refactoring the Models</h1>

<p>Implementing the Item object first, rather than the Link, was an obvious
choice because the Item is more autonomous. Each Item can mean something by
itself, it does not necessarily depend on other objects.

<p>That doesn't mean Items are unconstrained. As we saw in the API
implementation, the <em>id</em>, <em>created_at</em> and <em>created_by</em>
fields are set internally and cannot be modified. For me this is the difference
between an API and a data bucket ... one applies constraints, the other stores
anything you ask it to until it fills up.

<h2>Lifecycles</h2>

<p>The Items are the fundamental objects in this Electric Cat system. They
represent real world entities or actions and we never delete them; because
even if the thing that they represent in the real world is destroyed or
completed, we still want a lasting record of that thing.

<p>The lifecycle of an Item is thus:

<pre><code class="bash">Item created
Item modified
Item modified
...
</code></pre>

<p>In contrast, a Link represents a relationship between two Items at the
current time. It exists to group Items and navigate between them. It may be
the case that the relationship is permanent (for example: Task-X "fixes"
Bug-Y) or it may be that the relationship is transient (for example: Task-X
"blocks" Task-Z).

<p>As such a Link may be deleted, whereas an Item may not.

<pre><code class="bash">Link created
Link modified
Link modified
...
Link deleted
</code></pre>

<p>You can see at
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/tree/dfe73ffdb12acd40c27ad57e4497bdf405ed7fc7">this
version of the project</a> that I have implemented Links.

<h2>Refactoring</h2>

<p>The first phase of implementing Links was entirely test-driven. I wrote the
api_tests_link.py tests first and then added code until they passed. Much of
that new code was <em>cut and paste</em> from the Items implementation.

<p>Then, with working code, I examined the implementation for repetition and
duplication. A simple example is in the translator.py module where to_item and
to_link have a common structure that can be factored out into a fill_object
method.

<p>Another kind of refactoring that arises when you add more code is the
result of noticing that some responsibilities are lodged in the wrong class.

<p>My first attempt at refactoring the API class after adding create_item had
a new "private" method _no_immutables to check that incoming data was not
trying to sneakily set immutable fields.

<pre><code class="python">def _no_immutables(self, dictionary):
  if 'id' in dictionary:
    raise NotSavedError("id cannot be set externally")

  if 'created_at' in dictionary:
    raise NotSavedError("created_at cannot be set externally")

  if 'created_by' in dictionary:
    raise NotSavedError("created_by cannot be set externally")
</code></pre>

<p>This works... but is it the job of the API class to determine which data
fields are immutable? With only two types of data object that happen to have
the same immutable fields it is perhaps not crystal clear, but imagine adding
more objects in the future with different fields and then clearly it should
be the responsibility of the data models.

<p>The same thing goes for deciding if a Link has valid endpoints. The API
could extract the source and target and check for them in storage. Or it
could ask the Link if its endpoints are valid (passing in the storage
interface).

<p>We can refactor this:

<pre><code class="python">self._no_immutables(dictionary)

link = Link(user, dictionary)

self._source_and_target_valid(link)
</code></pre>

<p>Into this:

<pre><code class="python">try:
    link = Link(user, dictionary)
    link.check_endpoints(storage)

except ValueError as error:
    raise NotSavedError(error)
</code></pre>

<p>The trick with refactoring is to ask "Does the design of this code still
look right?" after each change. If the answer is no, then not refactoring it
means any further changes will be building on that flawed design... which is
accumulating a technical debt for the future.

<h2>Done?</h2>

<p>Now we have an API that can manage Items and Links. Is that enough to
start using it? Eager as I am to move on to creating Maps, there is one
tiny thing missing. Unless you record the <em>id</em> of each Item and Link
you create then how can you find it again?

<p>Obviously we need some search functionality.
