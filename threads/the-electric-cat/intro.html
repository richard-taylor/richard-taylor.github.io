<h1 class="title">Introduction to The Electric Cat</h1>

<p>Since I am starting this new project, I thought it might be interesting
to write about the process from the start, rather than just documenting it
afterwards.

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>For years I have worked with organisations that needed to make and track
connections between business requirements, implementations, tests,
documentation and various other types of "thing".

<p>There are tools to do that. But none of them cover the whole range of
"things" or types of connections very well. This is largely because in most
organisations the people who create the requirements are not the same people
who do the implementation. In turn, the people who do the implementation are
not always the same people who do the testing, or write all the documentation.

<p>So each group of people have their own favourite tools that do their bit
well. And the most general tools start off as a special tool and then evolve
to cover more types of "thing" with varying degrees of success.

<p>In order to track the connections between these "things" in different
systems we end up creating unique-ish identifiers for each item and then
referencing those identifiers. Anyone who has seen comments like this knows
what I am talking about...

<pre><code class="python"># Implements PRJ-123 required by REQ-2, REQ-7 and REQ-66.
</code></pre>

<p>We end up with highly connected "things" but no easy way to navigate or
manage those connections.

<p>Which made me think about the characteristics I would like to see in a
more universal system. And I thought about it on and off for several years.
Finally deciding to kick something off here. But not really having a
compelling reason to put much effort in...

<p>Until I went to <em>Lean Agile Brighton 2019</em> and heard
<a href="https://leadingedgeforum.com/researchers/simon-wardley/">Simon Wardley</a>
speak about <em>Mapping</em>. It occurred to me that I had been stuck thinking
about graphs and how I might be able to make better use of them. But turning
graphs into maps? Wow, that is an exciting prospect that could deliver real
insight instead of, or as well as, some pretty diagrams.

<p>And so the purpose became clear...

<p><em>The Electric Cat</em> is a tool for connecting and mapping
whatever items you need to track to make your endeavour a success.
