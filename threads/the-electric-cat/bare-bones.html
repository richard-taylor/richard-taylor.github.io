<h1 class="title">Bare Bones</h1>

<p>There is an old joke about a lost traveller who asks a local "Excuse
me. Can you tell me the way to the station?" and the local replies "Oh, if
I was going to the station, I wouldn't start from here."

<p>We always have to start from where we are. I could go off and research the
latest API frameworks. But I already have a skeleton application that can
stand up an HTTP server with only a few lines of Python code. So I am going
to start with that.

<p>The project needs a short working name... and "thelca" doesn't appear to
be in wide use, or mean anything offensive. Of course we need source control
so here is <a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca">the thelca
project on github</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/commit/6f1414886051570a41347be888b2d201d4a1612a">first significant commit</a>
I made.

<h2>What is minimal?</h2>

<p>Notice the following things in that first commit.

<h3>1. README</h3>

<p>A quick description of the project with a link to more detailed
documentation. The README is likely to be the first thing people see when
they discover your project, so keep it up to date and useful.

<p>One thing I like to put near the top is a section on running the tests.
Mainly because having tests is the difference between a <em>professional</em>
maintainable project and a quick hack you did one Wednesday afternoon.

<h3>2. Tests</h3>

<p>Having tests is essential, right from the start of the project. So get off
to a good start. Write tests from day 1. Do test-driven-development (TDD) if
that works for you. Or write some code and then some tests if you prefer. But
always write tests. They pay for themselves many times over.

<p>And make it easy to run the tests. I have wrapped the commands into a
simple bash script with a name starting "test" so that I don't have to
remember what to type.

<h3>3. Not much code</h3>

<p>The code itself does very little here. But it does do something. There is
just enough to show that we have a commitment to writing tests, a test runner,
a main program runner and some documentation to get people started easily.

<p>This is enough to show that we have all the moving parts we will need.

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>Let's see what this bare bones project does so far.

<pre><code class="bash"># thelca/bin/test_thelca.sh
test_versions (test_http.TestHTTP) ... ok

------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK
</code></pre>

<p>Great. All of the tests pass. So there is a chance the application might
start up and do something.

<pre><code class="bash"># thelca/bin/run_thelca.sh
2019-11-06 20:00:15,535 INFO Starting a server on port 2207
2019-11-06 20:00:15,561 INFO Entering the server loop
</code></pre>

<p>Looks promising. Can we <em>GET</em> anything from that port?

<pre><code class="bash"># curl http://localhost:2207/
Hello
</code></pre>

<p>Yes we can.

<p>Cool. That's the foundations laid. Now we can build on it.
