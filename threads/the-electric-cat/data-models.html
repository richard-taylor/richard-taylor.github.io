<h1 class="title">Data Models - part 1</h1>

<p>by <a href="../contact.html">Richard Taylor</a>

<p>I am calling this "part 1" because I don't expect to get it right first
time. Partly because I am only thinking about the external view of the data
at this stage: by which I mean the data as it is handled by the API.

</figure>

<p>Which is quite deliberate. I want to get the main concepts sorted out in
the API first, so that I can completely decouple the internal representation
from whatever UI frameworks I try out later.

<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p>It's often hard to get started when you are staring at a blank page. So I
usually blast down something to get me going and then rewrite it as I think
through the implications.

<p>Lets start with the most basic data. We have <em>Items</em> and
<em>Links</em> that we want to be trackable. So that says to me that we need a
<em>Trackable</em> base class to hold the tracking; and other classes that
extend it with their own specific data and functionality.

<pre><code class="python">class Trackable
class Item(Trackable)
class Link(Trackable)
class User(Trackable)
</code></pre>

<p>Then again, maybe composition is better than inheritance. Which of these
statements makes more sense:
an Item <em>is a</em> Trackable thing;
or an Item <em>has a</em> Trackable thing?

<p>To me, both seem very similar. And the good news is that for now at least
the choice is invisible to users of the classes so I'll stick with inheritance
and change later if needs be.

<p>I wouldn't normally make lots of commits while playing at this stage, but
to illustrate the process here is a
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/commit/4ba79d212592e3cd95b7eba4793c24c2dee47b8a">very
early version</a> of the model.

<p>Notice that I am deliberately populating all fields with built-in types
rather than library classes:

<pre><code class="python">self.id = str(uuid.uuid4())
self.created_by = created_by.id
self.created_at = datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
</code></pre>

<p>One reason for this is that I want to be able to convert these models to
JSON really easily, without defining custom converters. The second is that
I don't want Trackable objects to contain nested Trackable objects; instead
I want these objects to reference other Trackable objects.

<p>For example. Rather than storing the User who created an Item inside each
Item like this:

<pre><code class="json">{
  'id': '1b8d44d0-0fba-11ea-9cb9-b707013a9afa',
  'created_by': {
    'id': '271d411a-0fba-11ea-8c2b-23aad820de64',
    'name': 'The Electric Cat',
    'email': 'electric.cat@example.org',
    'shoe-size': 'N/A'
  },
  'type': 'STORY',
  'properties': {
    'DESCRIPTION': 'Once upon a time there were...'
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I simply want to record the <em>id</em> of the User like this:

<pre><code class="json">{
  'id': '1b8d44d0-0fba-11ea-9cb9-b707013a9afa',
  'created_by': '271d411a-0fba-11ea-8c2b-23aad820de64',
  'type': 'STORY',
  'properties': {
    'DESCRIPTION': 'Once upon a time there were...'
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because that is more compact, avoids returning data that might not be
required and avoids returning multiple copies of the same data.

<h2>Design Choices</h2>

<p>So you can see, even with these early stages of model design, I am making
design choices. I'm thinking about how these classes might be used. And
something that always helps with that is writing unit tests.

<p>Take a look at the tests in the
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/commit/4ba79d212592e3cd95b7eba4793c24c2dee47b8a">linked
commit</a>. I am creating objects in different ways and making some assertions
about their properties. What should the ID of an empty Item be?

<p>These tests help me think about how I will use the objects I am writing. Do
I write all the tests first? TDD? No, not all the time. Here I actually wrote
the test_empty tests before the code, but then wrote some of the code before
adding the other tests.

<p>Now I am thinking about how these classes look in action. I am wondering if
'type' should be a top-level field of Item and Link after all... or maybe it
should just be part of the properties?

<pre><code class="python"># A
item = Item(self.user, 'EPIC', {'DESCRIPTION': 'big'})

# B
item = Item(self.user, {'TYPE': 'EPIC', 'DESCRIPTION': 'big'})
</code></pre>

<p>What's the rationale for keeping it separate? It looked fine in the
module code, but in use it looks odd. Because it is not fixed, the type of
an Item could be changed from EPIC to STORY, just as the DESCRIPTION can be
changed. So it looks like it should be a property.

<p>With that change made, maybe next we can look at an API to read and write
these objects.
