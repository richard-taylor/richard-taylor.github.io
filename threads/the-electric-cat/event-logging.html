<h1 class="title">Users, Tokens and Event Logging</h1>

<p>by <a href="../contact.html">Richard Taylor</a>
    : <span class="date_created">2020-02-18</span>

<p>The reason that I want to tackle logging now, while there is not much code,
is that it can take an awful lot of refactoring to change something that sits in
every single API method. So I put in this <em>requesting_user</em> parameter
everywhere as a reminder... and now it's time to sort out what that means.

<p>One thing that has become clear in the last few years is that the place for
managing user data is <em>not in every single service</em>. If this concept is
new to you then there is a good
<a href="https://connect2id.com/learn/openid-connect">Introduction to
OpenID Connect</a> which is very readable.

<p>So am I going to implement an integration to an OAuth 2.0 provider before
I do anything else? No. I just need to be aware of the concepts and put in
the appropriate placeholders.

<h2>Tokens not Users</h2>

<p>The workflow for a client using our API with authentication will be:
<ol>
<li>Client logs into a third-party service to get a <em>token</em>.
<li>Client passes the token to the API as part of every request.
<li>API extracts the user id and permissions from the token.
<li>API either grants or refuses access to the resource requested.
</ol>

<p>The way that the client passes the token to the API is via a HTTP header:

<pre><code class="bash">Authorization: Bearer wKICJleHAiOiAxMzExMjgxOT
</code></pre>

<p>The token is Base64 encoded (and usually a bit longer than I have shown).
At this stage it doesn't matter where the token comes from. Our test code can
just make one up and pass it to the API.

<pre><code class="python">def invent_a_jwt():
    return {'Authorization': 'Bearer abcd'}

class TestBlackBoxItemAPI(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.url = 'http://localhost:2207/v1/items'

    def test_post_succeeds_for_empty_json(self):

        response = requests.post(self.url,
                                 data = '{}',
                                 headers = invent_a_jwt())

        self.assertEqual(200, response.status_code)
</code></pre>

<p>And our HTTP Server can extract the token from the header and pass it to
the API instead of the made-up User that we had before. Which means we change
the API methods from:

<pre><code class="python">def get_item(self, id, requesting_user)

def create_item(self, dictionary, requesting_user)

def update_item(self, id, item, requesting_user)
</code></pre>

<p>to

<pre><code class="python">def get_item(self, id, token)

def create_item(self, dictionary, token)

def update_item(self, id, item, token)
</code></pre>

<p>But what do we do with the token? Given that our test code just made one
up! Well, we delegate to an Authority object:

<pre><code class="python">from thelca.auth import Authority

authority = Authority()
</code></pre>

<p>This object doesn't have to <em>do</em> any authorisation yet, it just has
to have the same interface as the object that will later when we implement it
properly.

<p>Let's look at the updated get_item method:

<pre><code class="python">def get_item(self, id, token):
    item = storage.find_item(id)
    user = authority.check_read_item(token, item)

    logging.item_read(item, user)
    return item
</code></pre>

<p>We find the item first, then check whether we have the authority to access
it. That's because the check might depend on some property of the item. If the
check fails then the authority object raises a <em>NotAuthorisedError</em>.
However if it succeeds then the authority object returns some kind of
identifier for the user which we can use to log the event before returning
the item.

<p>So we do not need any representation of a User in the API at all. The token
represents the user and the authority object extracts the user identifier from
the token for us.

<p>For the time being all we need the authority object to do is:
<ul>
<li>Model the authorisation interface
<li>Raise a NotAuthorisedError if there is no token
<li>Raise a NotAuthorisedError for a known test token
<li>Return a user identifier that is derived from the token
</ul>

<p>And this does all of that for what we need in get_item:

<pre><code class="python">def check_read_item(self, token, item):
    if token is None or token == 'BAAD':
        raise NotAuthorisedError()
    else:
        return "a-test-only-id-" + token
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have all the pieces we need to write the rest of the API without
having to implement the actual integration to an OAuth 2.0 provider. We can
do that integration later when we need it; without having to change any of
the API code.

<h2>Event Logging</h2>

<p>Since we have nailed down how to know who is accessing the API, we can
think about how to log what they do.

<p>You can see at
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/tree/f5286d932b8a6663119c040d32d8ec7f53b516ae">this
version of the project</a> that I have
added a logging.py module. Under the hood this uses the standard python
'logging' module to write lines to a file. That is not important right now;
what matters is that our API passes all the relevant information to the
logging.py module so that we can send it where it needs to go.

<p>Take a look at the api.py module. You can see that every method logs the
data it is about to return; and who it is returning it to:

<pre><code class="python">def get_item(self, id, token):
    ...
    logging.item_read(item, user)
    return item

def create_item(self, dictionary, token):
    ...
    logging.item_created(item, user)
    return item

def update_item(self, id, item, token):
    ...
    logging.item_updated(item, user)
    return item
</code></pre>

<p>In each case the 'user' is the identifier extracted from the token by our
authority object as described above. And the 'item' is the full Item object.

<p>At this version I am writing out the full object for item_created and
item_updated, since these operations change the Item object; and I am writing
out the object identifier for item_read since it does not change the Item
object.

<p>This stream has enough information to reconstruct the data we have stored
in memory for any point in time. It is probably too verbose, but I want to get
it working first before worrying about efficiency.

<p>Here is an example of what the thelca-events.log file contains after a
number of requests have been processed. It is one JSON object per line but
I have formatted it to make it more readable:

<pre><code class="bash">{"time": "2020-02-18T16:37:09.654949+00:00",
 "type": "Item created",
 "user": "a-test-only-id-abcd",
 "value": {"created_at": "2020-02-18T16:37:09.654917+00:00",
           "created_by": "a-test-only-id-abcd",
           "id": "5f73f540-c125-435d-8a5e-6fea05672b7a",
           "properties": null}}

{"time": "2020-02-18T16:37:09.658768+00:00",
 "type": "Item updated",
 "user": "a-test-only-id-abcd",
 "value": {"created_at": "2020-02-18T16:37:09.654917+00:00",
           "created_by": "a-test-only-id-abcd",
           "id": "5f73f540-c125-435d-8a5e-6fea05672b7a",
           "properties": {"type": "STORY"}}}

{"time": "2020-02-18T16:37:09.662897+00:00",
 "type": "Item read",
 "user": "a-test-only-id-abcd",
 "value": "5f73f540-c125-435d-8a5e-6fea05672b7a"}
</code></pre>

<p>From here it is
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/commit/4c9889c63a40a9209880d63ff16ffc8a953eabc7">not
much work</a> to optionally read the event log when the server starts up and
restore the Items that were previously constructed.

<h2>Next</h2>

<p>The API is now very solid for Item objects. We have POST to create, GET to
read and PUT to update. We want to keep objects for audit purposes, so we will
not be implementing DELETE (more on that later).

<p>There are placeholders for authentication and authorisation; and a mechanism
to log all user actions in a way that also enables all the stored Items to
be restored by replaying the events recorded in the log.

<p>So next we can go and implement Link objects.
