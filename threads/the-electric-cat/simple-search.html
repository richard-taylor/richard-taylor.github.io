<h1 class="title">Simple Searches</h1>

<p>The use of Links to explicitly represent different types of connections
between Items has several advantages. One of them is that you can use the
resulting connectivity to help you find useful groups of things.

<p>For example, if we want to say that an EPIC contributes to a PROJECT, then
we can represent that relationship with a CONTAINS link.

<pre><code class="bash">Item(type=PROJECT) + Link(type=CONTAINS) + Item(type=EPIC)
</code></pre>

<p>This is much more powerful than simply adding a "project" property to the
EPIC. Firstly, the PROJECT can be a first-class citizen of our data world,
with as many of its own properties and relationships as we need. And
secondly, the EPIC can easily be associated with more than one PROJECT, and in
different ways; it may have a CONTAINS link with one PROJECT and an ASSISTS
link with another.

<h2>Find an Item</h2>

<p>To start exploring you need an entry point. So the first thing to do is
implement a very simple search that can find Items based on their properties.

<p>You can see in
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/commit/5d0737751ef71a0623b1e35001f2c8ddee6a33ea">this
commit</a> I have gone super simple. The basic search for Items is of this
form:

<pre><code class="bash">GET /v1/items?type=PROJECT
</code></pre>

<p>Where "type" is a property name and "PROJECT" is the property value. For
the time being only one property is queried, but it is easy to see how this
could be extended.

<p>What is not so obvious is how this could be extended to advanced queries.
Say we wanted to find something using a syntax like a programming language:

<pre><code class="python">type in {EPIC, STORY} and created_at during 2020-02
</code></pre>

<p>How would that fit into a URL query string? With all the escaping required
it would be pretty unreadable. I think it is likely that advanced queries will
be better sent as base64 encoded strings.

<p>Anyway, I digress, that question is for another day. Take a look at the
search_items method in the api.py module:

<pre><code class="python">items = storage.find_items(key, value)

(user, filtered_items) = \
authority.filter_readable_items(token, items)

logging.item_search(filtered_items, user)
return filtered_items
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we need the Authority object to filter the search results and
remove any Items that the user does not have permission to see. Obviously this
could leave us with an empty list; or a NotAuthorisedError if the user does
not have permission to carry out searches at all.

<p>Before returning the list we log the IDs of all the Items in the result.

<h2>Follow the Links</h2>

<p>Once we have a starting point we can expand our exploration by following
Links from an Item. To do this we don't need to search for Links by their
properties, but by their "source" and "target" attributes:

<pre><code class="bash">GET /v1/links?source=123456
GET /v1/links?target=123456
GET /v1/links?either=123456
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we can explicitly say "Item 123456 is the source" or "Item
123456 is the target" or we can use "either" to say that we want all the
Links where "Item 123456 is the source or the target".

<p>Again in the code we use the Authority object to "hide" any Links that
the user should not see:

<pre><code class="python">(user, filtered_links) = \
authority.filter_readable_links(token, links)

logging.link_search(filtered_links, user)
return filtered_links
</code></pre>

<p>And log the IDs of the Links that we return.

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>As you would expect there is a new test module api_tests_search.py which
sets up a few Items with Links between them and then does a variety of
successful and unsuccessful searches.

<p>Now we have enough of an API to play with. It is pretty minimal, on purpose.
This is the Agile way. Make enough to try out, then learn what you need to do
next by using what you already have.
