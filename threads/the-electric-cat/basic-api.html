<h1 class="title">Basic API</h1>

<p>by <a href="../contact.html">Richard Taylor</a>
    : <span class="date_created">2019-12-20</span>

<p>The most basic API needs to be able to create and store things, then
retrieve them later. I'll make it really simple by only worrying about one
type of thing for now, the Item.

<p>What I want to explore is the structure of the API. You can only change
things around freely if they are quite small. So it needs to be minimal; but
still complex enough to surface the main choices.

<h2>New Modules</h2>

<p>You can see from
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/commit/2d1507607dce8b8fb052a76cf32e5a098d126af4">this
commit</a> that I have added three new modules.

<pre><code class="bash">api
storage
translator
</code></pre>

<p>But where are the tests? There are no unit tests for these modules, yet.

<p>That's because I was trying to get it straight in my mind which modules I
needed. Should the <em>api</em> module accept objects or strings or
dictionaries? Without seeing it in use it is hard to say. I could have written
some unit tests for <em>api</em> to examine its usage, but in this case it
seemed like the picture would be clearer if I examined how the <em>api</em>
fit inside the <em>http</em> module.

<p>So I did have tests, but they were integration tests. For example, this
"test" shows that the POST handler is working as expected:
<pre><code class="bash"># curl -d '{}' http://localhost:2207/v1/items | jq
{
  "id": "2d146ed4-7fc2-49fd-a929-b2f5af16f27b",
  "properties": null,
  "created_at": "2019-12-24T17:09:38.472232+00:00",
  "created_by": "e1aafc4d-32e4-44be-a00d-48ecc253f7cb"
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then this shows that I can GET the data back later:
<pre><code class="bash"># curl http://localhost:2207/v1/items/2d146ed4-7fc2-49fd-a929-b2f5af16f27b | jq
{
  "id": "2d146ed4-7fc2-49fd-a929-b2f5af16f27b",
  "properties": null,
  "created_at": "2019-12-24T17:09:38.472232+00:00",
  "created_by": "e1aafc4d-32e4-44be-a00d-48ecc253f7cb"
}
</code></pre>

<p>What did I learn? Well, looking at <em>http</em> I decided that passing
strings into <em>api</em> would be a mistake. The <em>http</em> module is
the thing that knows about the incoming and outgoing data formats (JSON, XML,
whatever) as it sees the HTTP headers. So that module should convert those
formats into objects for the <em>api</em>; which then only needs to understand
objects not JSON, XML etc.

<p>Also, having said that, I don't want the actual code for translating from
text to objects to live in the <em>http</em> module. It should live in a
separate module - hence the appearance of the <em>translator</em> module
which does only that - it translates.

<p>And the third module? It seems like a no-brainer to not tie the API to a
paricular data persistence technology right from the start. So I created a
<em>storage</em> module to house the interface to persitent storage and
implemented it as an in-memory store to begin with.

<h2>Abstractions</h2>

<p>The basic API clearly now works. I can POST an Item in and then GET it
back later. In the process of making this work I have established some key
abstractions which separate different functionality.

<ol>
<li>Server - all the server code is in the <em>http</em> module. That is the
only place that has to worry about HTTP headers and return codes.
<li>Translator - converting from standard formats to objects and back again
is all done here.
<li>API - the server interacts with the data through this <em>versioned</em>
interface. It is so important to build in versioning from the start with any
API. You will need it sooner or later!
<li>Storage - the API interacts with the persisted data through this
interface.
</ol>

<h2>Unfinished Business</h2>

<p>There is something I have thrown in to this commit which doesn't do much and
is mostly there as a statement of intent. Users; all the API calls have a
"requesting_user" parameter, even though there is no way to log in or register
users. This is because I want to build in strong logging as soon as possible.
Actual authorisation can come later.

<p>With the basic API structure now definied, what we need next are more tests.
