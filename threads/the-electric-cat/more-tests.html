<h1 class="title">Test Driven Refinement</h1>

<p>by <a href="../contact.html">Richard Taylor</a>

<p>We knocked ideas around to get our basic API. Now's the time to solidify
what we have by writing some more tests.

<p>If the structure of the API or the underlying components isn't quite right
then those issues should surface as we add unit tests. Then we can add some
higher level tests on top of that stronger foundation.

<h2>Translator Unit Tests</h2>

<p>There is not a great deal to test in the translator.py module. But one thing
did come up. Sorting the JSON keys makes the output more consistent and thus
easier to test.

<pre><code class="python">json.dumps(values, sort_keys=True)
</code></pre>

<p>And in case you didn't know; there is an assertRaises method in unittest:

<pre><code class="python">self.assertRaises(TranslationError,
                  self.translate.to_item, '{blah}')
</code></pre>

<p>Which makes testing for exceptions easier. Note that the method under test
<em>to_item</em> and its parameter <em>'{blah}'</em> are two separate
parameters to <em>assertRaises</em> not one. The two lines above are equivalent
to:

<pre><code class="python">try:
    self.translate.to_item('{blah}')
    self.fail("expected a TranslationError to be raised")
except TranslationError:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>but a lot shorter.

<h2>Storage Unit Tests</h2>

<p>There is also not a lot to test in the storage.py module. But I quickly
noticed that I had been lazy and returned <em>None</em> from the find_item
method when there was no item found. This is poor design so I changed it to
raise a new ItemNotFound exception instead.

<p>I expect this change to cause a failure elsewhere in code that assumes
<em>None</em> means not found. So lets try and provoke that with a test.

<h2>API Unit Tests</h2>

<p>Sure enough the first few tests for the api.py module fail when we try
to call get_item for a non-existent identifier.

<p>And it seems clear that we need to move the definitions of the API
exceptions out of the lower-level modules into a error.py module so that
api.py does not have to catch the exceptions from storage.py just to rethrow
them as a more generic type.

<p>For example, in storage.py we have:

<pre><code class="python">def find_item(self, id):
    try:
        return self.items[id]
    except KeyError:
        raise ItemNotFound()
</code></pre>

<p>Where <em>ItemNotFound</em> is an exception from error.py which is also
the expected result from API.get_item when the item does not exist. So all
that method needs is:

<pre><code class="python">return storage.find_item(id)
</code></pre>

<p>which will raise the <em>ItemNotFound</em> when expected.

<p>That gets us to
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/tree/7c7c1215497f5bf1ceea20fa22acbe86fa09a961">this
version of the project</a>. We have unit tests for all the functionality, but
no formal black-box tests for the whole API.

<h2>Black Box API Tests</h2>

<p>To test the whole API we need a server running, so the tests have to be
separate from the unit tests. Also it is a good idea to not use the code that
we are testing in black-box tests.

<p>I created a separate runner for these tests:

<pre><code class="bash">bin/api_test_thelca.sh
</code></pre>

<p>which runs all tests fitting the pattern <em>api_tests_*.py</em>

<p>Note that the first new test <em>api_tests_item.py</em> does not import
any modules from <em>thelca</em> but instead uses the popular python
'requests' module that you will probably need to install.

<pre><code class="python">import requests
import unittest

class TestBlackBoxItemAPI(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.url = 'http://localhost:2207/v1/items'

    def test_get_fails_for_non_item(self):
        response = requests.get(self.url + '/no-such-id')
        self.assertEqual(404, response.status_code)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see this makes it very easy to write black-box tests for the
API using requests and the unittest framework to make assertions.

<p>Once you step back from the code and write black-box tests then you often
find bugs that you completely overlooked when you were close to the code. For
example, I discovered that the API was returning <em>SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE</em>
when I passed in certain 'bad' JSON strings, instead of <em>BAD_REQUEST</em>.
That's because when I wrote the code I thought it could only fail if there
was an internal problem... but then put some checking into that method which
meant it could fail if the request was bad.

<p>Another thing I discovered was that passing in additional fields just
propagated them through instead of stripping them out. This test:

<pre><code class="python">def test_post_ignores_extra_fields(self):
    response = requests.post(self.url, data = '''
    {
        "properties": { "type": "BUG", "status": "OPEN" },
        "secret": "you aint seen me, right?"
    }
    ''')
    self.assertEqual(200, response.status_code)

    json = response.json()
    self.assertNotIn('secret', json)
</code></pre>

<p>failed until I fixed the code and 'secret' vanished.

<h2>Foray Into TDD</h2>

<p>Having written the tests above I knew I needed to implement the <em>PUT</em>
method next, so that Items can be updated once created. Since I now have some
nice black-box tests for <em>GET</em> and <em>POST</em> it seemed natural to
write the tests for <em>PUT</em> before writing the code - Test Driven
Development. So this is what I did:
<ol>
<li>Wrote the API tests for PUT in the same style as POST
<li>Checked that they failed
<li>Implemented the code for PUT
<li>Checked that the tests now passed
<li>Looked at the modules with new code
<li>Added unit tests for the new methods and cases I had added
</ol>

<p>And after that we have 27 unit tests and 17 API tests and the
<a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor/thelca/tree/edd4ab06bdb7cc9d066c97ba23318f0672fadf8c">project
is in this state</a>. Note that I added some notes to the README on how to
run the API tests.

<h2>Still Unfinished Business</h2>

<p>Now we have implemented the main API methods for Items and written
tests to show that the implementation is correct. It is tempting to crack
on and implement Links as well. But before I do that I want to tackle the
strong logging that I promised.

<p>So the next step is to log all the changes made by the API in such a way
that every change can be audited; and the state of all the stored Items can
be restored by replaying the events recorded in the log.
