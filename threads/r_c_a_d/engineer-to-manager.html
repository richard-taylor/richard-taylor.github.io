<h1 class="title">Transition from Engineer to Manager</h1>

<h2>The Short Version</h2>

<p>I was a computer scientist for 15 years, then a software engineer for
14 years, then about 2 years ago transitioned into managing software
engineers.

<p>Management is hard. But doable. It is not an engineering problem, it is
a people problem.

<h2>The Inspiration</h2>

<p>I saw a story on "hacker news" where a manager proudly declared:

<p><em>A big part of what I do as an engineering manager is stopping truly
brilliant people from executing on plans that begin with the words "I can
just do this myself in a weekend."</em> 

<p>Mentally I added that to the long list of things that <em>bad managers</em>
have said to me over the years. I wanted to write an article immediately to
explain why it was bad. I wrote a quick draft. 

<p>One day I might finish it. Until then, this is a placeholder.
