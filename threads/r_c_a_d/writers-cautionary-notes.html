<h1 class="title">Cautionary Notes for Aspiring Writers</h1>

<h2>The Short Version</h2>

<p>For many years I wanted to be a <i>writer</i>. If you do too, there are
lots of people who will tell you that you can be if you keep trying. Most of
those people are either fooling themselves or hoping to make money by selling
you services.

<p>I failed to become a writer. I'm not telling you not to try. I'm telling
you that if you do try you are very unlikely to succeed. It's not an easy thing
to hear. But it is true.

<p>If the notes here can help someone, in some way, then maybe my time wasn't
all wasted.

<h2>The Beginning</h2>

<p>My first novel was written in 2002. I'd been in my dream job for about 7
years and the novelty was wearing off, as long-term projects lost momentum and
the pressure to think of something completely new increased.

<p>Writing is hard. Until that point in my life, completing something that was
hard was the hard part. Everything else just followed on. Didn't it?

<p>It seems naive now. But I really thought that after completing my novel, and
being happy with it, finding a publisher was a matter of time. I didn't think
it would be easy. In fact I gave myself a year to do it.

<p>After about six months I was almost completely disillusioned. I'd started
reading up on getting published and finally realised that it wasn't just hard
to get published, it was, statistically, highly unlikely.

<h2>Persistence is Useless</h2>

<small>[to misquote Douglas Adams]</small>

<p>You can spend the rest of your life trying to get your first novel published.
Or you can move on with the second. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.
So I set about doing both.

<p>My plan for Eddie Shore was for a series of pairs of books: in the first of
each pair his life would take a down-turn, and in the second things would
pick up. The paired books would be set over a few days or weeks, but the
gap between each pair would be ten years.

<p>So I needed to get on with book 2...
then book 3 could wait until after 2011.

<p>Writing the second novel was fun. Maybe more so than the first. But my
efforts on finding a publisher (or an agent) were getting nowhere.
I stuck at it.

<p>Today when I see #amwriting is trending on Twitter I feel sad. I imagine
thousands of aspiring writers struggling to finish their great work, all
hoping that it will be discovered. For nearly all of them, it wont.

<h2>One for Sorrow, Two for Joy</h2>

<p>With two <i>completed</i> novels you might think you have a better chance of
getting them published. After all, you have shown that you are not a one-trick
pony. You have the makings of a series!

<p>I think it was at this point that I got my first vaguely positive comment
from an agent. He said that he liked my first novel (based on the first few
chapters), but it was too short to be commercial.

<p>Too short? At 55,000 words it was longer than plenty of the published novels
on my shelves. But the fashion at that point was for doorstops of 75,000
- 100,000 words.

<p>Was this correct, or was he just trying to reject my book politely?

<p>I was tempted to combine my two novels into one. Psychologically this was a
hard thing to do. In my mind I had written two novels. They were distinct to
me.

<p>Anyway, I bit the bullet and tried it. Two became one.

<h2>Postcards from the Ed</h2>

<p>One of the oddest things that happened when I was trying to get ESatM
published, was a postcard I received from a niche publisher. In response
to my submission the card basically said "<i>We don't publish that kind of
book. So don't send us stuff. You idiot.</i>"

<p>Not in those exact words. There was a reference to their submission
guidelines, with the assertion that I obviously hadn't read them.

<p>Of course, I had read the guidelines. And in fact I had referred to them in
my covering letter... along with the reasons why I thought my novel was a
fit for their catalogue.

<p>But then the publisher probably didn't even skim my letter. He was probably
just clearing his desk on a Friday afternoon by sending out <i>Get Lost</i>
postcards to the last dozen submissions that remained ... so he could get a
fresh start the following Monday.

<p>At least I got a reply on that occassion. About half the publishers I
approached never replied at all...

<h2>Free Today, Free Tomorrow</h2>

<p>By 2006 I had a new job and ideas for 2 completely new novels. My plan for
Eddie Shore was still to write another part set in 2011... so he could wait a
few more years. I wanted to move on with something else.

<p>But in my heart of hearts I knew ESatM and ES4J weren't going to get
published. I'd stopped sending them out to publishers. Self-publishing seemed
the only way, but lots of people were saying <i>don't go there</i> -
self-pub was still considered vanity publishing at the time.

<p>I did it anyway. Going with Lulu, who seemed the best... they even allowed
you to get listed on Amazon. But that's not such a big deal when you are one of
thousands of unknown authors all vying for attention.

<p>In the first few months I only had single-digit sales.
And in the six months after that, nothing.

<p>The whole <i>getting published</i> thing was getting me down. I wanted to
move on. So I decided to put the first novel(s) to bed. I put them on my
website as free downloads; with a link to the print copies if people wanted
to go delux.

<p>Did I really think anyone would buy the print books, just because I made the
downloads free? Yes, I did, for a while. Did people download the book? Yes...
I think - there were hundreds of downloads, possibly all from search engines
and web-crawlers. Did I make any sales? Two.

<p>Giving away my book for free was an act of closure. A final recognition
that I was never going to get any financial reward for all the work I'd put in.
I moved on.

<h2>Lulu</h2>

<p>Did anyone really buy many books from Lulu?</p>

<p>I did once. I bought "King of the Kindness Room" and "Elmore and Hen" by
Andrew James Stevenson. Admittedly in the hope that the author would buy my
book in return... but he didn't. No problem. They are actually both really
good. And no longer available on Lulu!

<p>In the 10 years that my books were available on Lulu, I sold 14 copies.
And that might include the 6 copies that I bought myself for family.

<p>At that rate it would take 61 years to make back what I paid for ISBNs.

<h2>Easier Said Than Done</h2>

<p>It is one thing to say you have moved on, another thing to believe it,
and something else to actually have done it.

<p>Having written 20-30K words on my third novel (<i>The Square Triangles</i>)
I really wasn't happy with it. Was it the ghost of Eddie Shore haunting me?
Maybe. All those rejections hurt; and you don't ever forget them, really,
do you?

<p>My problem wasn't writer's block. It was something of the opposite.
I thought I had two strong ideas for books and went with the strongest.
But as TST developed I found myself thinking about the other idea and
wondering if I should have done that first.

<p>Several times I paused TST and worked on the other idea (still untitled).
Each time I convinced myself that TST was the book to write first and went
back to it.

<p>In the middle of this confusion I discovered that Amazon had started letting
authors publish directly for the Kindle on their site. Could this be a final
chance for my earlier novels? Surely some people would be prepared to pay a
minimal price for them.

<p>So I did it. Proving that I hadn't moved on I made Kindle versions of
ESatM and ES4J. Pricing both at the lowest mark, $0.99, in the hope that a
few adventurous souls might give it a go.

<p>Did they? Well, I can tell you that according to Amazon my two Kindle books
have sold, between them, in the first 5 years... exactly zero copies.

<p>[update May 2018: I have now sold a handful of copies of both books and get
a tiny trickle of royalties (pennies per year) from Kindle Unlimited]

<p>[update July 2019: Amazon banned one of my books because it noticed
that the same text had been on my own website. Rather than battle to explain
that I had not plagiarised <i>myself</i>, for a few pennies, I pulled all
my books from the Kindle]

<h2>Amazon wins; Readers win; Authors lose</h2>

<p>In the early 21st century, not getting your book on Amazon meant that no-one
was going to see it. If no-one saw it, no-one bought it and your career as a
writer was going nowhere.

<p>Then everyone and their grandmother got on the internet. Quite quickly
everyone was on Amazon, or at least available from their site indirectly.
Now no-one was going to see your book because there were just zillions of
books on Amazon / the internet.

<p>When everyone can get <i>published</i> on-line it is a bloodbath for
authors. Sure a few make a lot of money. But most authors make very little.
And many authors make nothing at all.

<p>I bet that if you look at all the books that first became available in 2014,
the average number of sales will be less than 10 copies a year. In fact
I wouldn't be surprised if the median were less than 10 copies too. Why?
Because there are now thousands and thousands of books <i>published</i>
every year that no-one ever buys (apart from the authors themselves).

<p>Who wins here? Well, Amazon are still doing OK because they still sell plenty
of the hits. Readers are doing OK because they have a big choice of books to
buy. Readers also do OK because they can get hold of classic and out-of-print
books for nothing.

<p>My friend has had a Kindle for a couple of years and says she hasn't
bought a single book... she reads classics for free... and there are enough
to last her a lifetime.

<p>Authors have produced a massive over supply of books. There are just too
many. And most of them are rubbish. Finding the odd gem will get harder and
harder.

<p>Harder because, at the moment, there are too many fake reviews and
marketing hype behind books that are blessed by big players. Hopefully one
day there will be a way for people to get genuine reviews from impartial
readers ... but I'm not holding my breath.

<h2>The End</h2>

<p>When 2011 came and went I had another dilemma. I still wasn't happy
with <i>The Square Triangles</i>. Should I put it on hold and write book 3 of
the Eddie Shore series? It was supposed to be set in 2011... so I was
tempted. But no-one was interested in Eddie's story, despite 10 years
of trying to promote it.

<p>What to do? On the one hand was the book I needed to finish but couldn't
(TST) and on the other was a book I knew I could finish but no-one wanted
(ES3).

<p>I thought I'd settled it when a friend revealed that he had been
commissioned to write a non-fiction book. He thought it was going to be
tough to do in a year. We challenged each other. Hoping that we could push
each other to make progress. I decided to finish TST.

<p>A revelation helped. The main male character (Wyn) in TST just wasn't
right; he didn't fit with the female lead (Elspeth) and the children
(Nuala and Selwyn) in the way I wanted. But there were aspects of the male
lead in my shelved hard sci-fi novel that I really liked... so why not
parachute that guy into Wyn's shoes?

<p>It made sense. Why hadn't I thought of that before?

<p>Maybe if I'd thought of it earlier it would have made a difference.
But after an initially exciting period of two or three months I had lost
all my momentum again. Writing wasn't much fun. No-one was
interested in what I was doing.

<p>One day I just had a moment of clarity. <i>Why are you making yourself
unhappy?</i>

<p>It seemed a fair question. There wasn't a good answer.
It seemed pretty obvious that I would be happier if I just stopped
writing. So I did.

<h2>In for a Penny, In for a Penny</h2>

<p>Of course, you can't just stop writing. Not for ever.
Once I took the pressure off myself to complete anything, I was free to do
whatever I liked. For a while I really didn't write anything at all. I
read a lot instead; and watched a lot of films (movies).

<p>Then I wrote some poems, book reviews, film reviews. Not for any reason,
other than because I wanted to.
