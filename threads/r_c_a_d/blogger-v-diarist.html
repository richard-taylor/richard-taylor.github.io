<h1 class="title">Blogger versus Diarist</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When I finally decided to give up writing fiction, in the traditional sense,
it was quite liberating. That was some time around 2012. I dabbled with a few
different forms of writing and eventually started a <a
href="https://eddie-shore.blogspot.com/">blog</a> (it's rubbish BTW) way after
blogs stopped being cool. From time to time I go back to it... and quickly
remember why I shouldn't bother.  Instead, when I feel the need to write about
something opinionated, I put it in my diary. This time I also decided to write
this article about why I think that... which you could argue makes this kind of
a blog post rather than an article... so be it, I'm making an exception because
I think it needs saying out loud.

<h2>Why blogs <s>are</s> seem good</h2>

<p>The thing I liked about publishing a blog was that it was there on the
internet instantly and I could see how many people were reading it. I was
writing it as my character Eddie Shore so it was also a way to live out part of
another life, without spending a year writing a novel. But, from time to time,
there would be something that made me so mad that I just posted what I thought,
whether it was in keeping with the character or not. Usually not.

<p>Most of the time I didn't care how many people were reading my blog. But
sometimes I would care and would post links to Twitter and other places. Then
the hit count went up and I was happy.

<p>I thought my blog had something that at least some people wanted to read. It
was mostly movie and book reviews... but fairly obscure ones; so not the sort
of thing you would find on other blogs or review sites. And it was done in
character so it didn't have to pretend to be objective or unbiased. If people
liked the kind of movies I liked (or my character liked) then they might find
the blog interesting.

<p>I could write whatever I wanted. It didn't matter.

<h2>Why blogs are bad</h2>

<p>As soon as you have a blog there is an urge to put stuff on it. And keep
putting stuff on it. You don't want to be one of those people who start
blogging and give up after 7 posts. You have to create to maintain your
legitimacy.

<p>When you start churning out material to a timetable, the quality soon drops.
No-one has enough creativity to maintain high quality output indefinitely at a
regular pace. But also when you are churning stuff out, you want to be sure
that people are reading it. What's the point in all that writing if no-one
reads it?  So you put more "effort" into "marketing" your stuff. More links.
More clickbaity titles. And you need more "followers" on the trendy social
sites.

<p>Fundamentally, all the hits your blog gets from "marketing" are bullshit.
Most of them are probably automatic loads by robot accounts that will do
something nefarious with the content. Most of the rest are people who see the
content for a few seconds and move on because your title didn't describe what
you actually wrote (on purpose).

<p>Your content isn't as original as you think. There are so many people
posting so much on the internet, that the probability of someone else posting
something very similar to you is very high. Only a very small number of people
have something truly original to say...  and you will probably never find those
people amongst the noise of everyone else.

<p>You can't write whatever you like on the internet. Or rather, you can but
you'll regret it. That clever piece about your unrequited love for a coworker
might seem like genius today, but in 10 years time when she's CEO and someone
you pissed off sends her a link... not so much. And that's if you are lucky. If
you are unlucky then something that you don't even realise could ever be
offensive to anyone might get picked up by a group with a cause and you'll be
their next target on the road to justice.

<h2>Why diaries are the best</h2>

<p>People have been writing diaries and personal journals for hundreds of years.
There are lots of reasons for that, but fundamentally it helps people to "sort
out" their thoughts and make sense of recent events. For me it also satisfies
my need to write. The diaries of some great people get published posthumously
as historical records; most are never read by another human being.

<p>Blogs came along as a way to "share" your thoughts with other people. Which
was cute when there weren't so many people on the internet... OK, I'll say it,
and when most people on the internet were smart. Now everyone is on the
internet so, by definition, the average IQ is about 100. Just as you choose
your words differently in different company, you have to change your writing
for a different audience. For personal stuff, like your opinions, the effective
audience has shrunk to one... just you.

<p>So now I keep my opinions to myself (apart from this one) and put it all in
my diary. I know that the reader is interested in it, because I often read back
to times in the past I have forgotten. I know the number of unique readers is
exactly one. I don't have a timetable and only write when I want to; the reader
doesn't mind that at all. I don't do marketing. I <em>can</em> write exactly
what I want... and that <em>does</em> matter.
