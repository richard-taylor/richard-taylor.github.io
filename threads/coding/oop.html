<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>One of the problems that I have with "Object Oriented Programming" is that
the word "Object" itself can send people down the wrong path. Because we learn
at school that sentences have a "subject + verb + object" structure, we are
likely to be biased towards thinking of an "object" as a thing that something
happens to.

<p>Instead I like to think of an Object as representing a Concept. Any kind
of concept - a thing, an action or a relationship.

<h2>Basic Object Orientation</h2>

<p>Let's take a simple example from geometry of a two-dimensional point. We
can represent a point with an object. The object can contain data and it can
have methods.

<pre><code class="java">Point p = new Point(1, 2);
Point q = new Point(1, 3);

float d = p.distanceTo(q);
</code></pre>

<p>This style of OOP is sometimes called "ask don't tell". All the data is
hidden in the Point object and we ask it to compute things instead of getting
the data out to compute things ourselves.

<p>Which is fine if we know all the questions that an object might be asked,
or if we are happy to always add new methods for new questions.

<pre><code class="java">float e = p.euclideanDistanceTo(q);
float m = p.minkowskiDistanceTo(q);

// what does the original p.distanceTo(q) do now?
</code></pre>

<p>But then you also have to decide whether to remove old methods that might
no longer have a clear function... but may be in wide use by other code.

<p>Sometimes you start with a very well defined, small, concept that will
never be extended. So you go with "ask don't tell" and everything is fine.
Until the concept does need to be extended after all.

<h2>Objects Represent Concepts</h2>

<p>In the Point example above we assumed that a distance was a simple number
and that there was only one way to calculate the one true distance between
points.

<p>But distance is a concept, so we could have a Distance object instead.

<pre><code class="java">Point p = new Point(1, 2);
Point q = new Point(1, 3);

Distance d = new Distance(p, q);
</code></pre>

<p>And then we can extend that concept without changing the Point concept.

<pre><code class="java">Distance e = new EuclideanDistance(p, q);
Distance m = new MinkowskiDistance(p, q);
</code></pre>

<p>Also, we can express a distance between Point and Line objects...

<pre><code class="java">Line line = new Line(p, q);
Distance d = new EuclideanDistance(p, line);
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas with "ask don't tell" you have to choose to add the distance
method to either the Point object or the Line object, or both?

<pre><code class="java">// a equals b

float a = p.distanceTo(line);
float b = line.distanceTo(p);
</code></pre>

<h2>Actions Are Also Concepts</h2>

<p>When it comes to actions, it is common to think of the thing performing
the action as an object, with the action then being a method.

<pre><code class="java">Object obj = getSuspect();
Validator v = getValidator();

Boolean b = v.validate(obj);
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes it is neater to represent the action itself as an object;
especially if the action has multiple properties:

<pre><code class="java">Object obj = getSuspect();
Validate v = new Validate(obj);

Boolean b = v.asBoolean();
List&lt;String&gt; gripes = v.errors();
</code></pre>

<p>And action objects make a lot of sense if you are dealing with a set of
related actions. For example, if you have a robot that can execute different
types of movement, then representing each movement as an object seems quite
natural:

<pre><code class="java">Robot mickey = new Robot("Mickey");
List&lt;Move&gt; moves = getPreMoves();

moves.add(new Turn(90));
moves.add(new Walk(20));

mickey.do(moves);
</code></pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In "object oriented programming" it is easy to see how objects can be used
to represent "things" such as:

<ul>
<li>File
<li>Point
<li>User
</ul>

<p>But it is less obvious to see that objects can also represent relationships:

<ul>
<li>Link
<li>Distance
<li>Partnership
</ul>

<p>Actions can also be represented by objects:

<ul>
<li>Delete
<li>Translate
<li>Promote
</ul>

<p>And the real power of OOP comes when objects are used to represent all
of these different types of concepts, not just the "things".
