<h1 class="title">Why Beautiful Code Matters</h1>

<p>by <a href="../contact.html">Richard Taylor</a>
    : <span class="date_created">2019-01-30</span>

<p>I would hope that everyone who has ever written software for a living would
agree that this block of code is ugly.

<pre><code class="java">//this class adds numbers
class NumberAdder {
    private final int sum;
 public NumberAdder( int a,int y  ) { sum =y +a;}
public int getSUM() {
return sum;

}}
</code></pre>

<p>And yet I have been given code to review that contains all these "mistakes".
Thankfully not as concentrated, but there none the less. And usually
multiple times, even after pointing them out.

<p>The programmers submitting this code were usually very competent. So why
were they delivering ugly code? It had to be that they did not appreciate the
value of "beautiful code". Getting the code <em>delivered fast</em> seemed to
be trumping other considerations.

<p>I gave a talk on "Coding Consisency" subtitled "Why beautiful code is
important". The reaction was quite surprising. <em>"Cool. I wish we were
taught this stuff in college."</em> about sums it up.

<p>Here are some of the points from that talk.

<h2>1. Code Layout Matters</h2>

<p>Organisations do not create coding styles to suppress the creativity of
their employees. The style exists to remove <em>distractions</em> that make
it harder to understand what someone else has written, or what you wrote
yourself some time ago. FOr tHE saMe reaSON that ANY WRITteN m@teria1 not
foLLowING tHe uSUaL convENTion5 i5 haRDer tO FOLlow.

<p>Much as you may hate "the wrong style" chosen by the team you are in, if
you add code in a different style, then you have made the code as a whole
harder to read
and therefore harder to maintain. You have done a disservice to all the people
who will have to work on that code in the future (most likely including
yourself).

<p>As an extreme example of where this can lead I once had to modify a big Perl
script that had evolved over several years. The code was so hard to follow that
each poor soul tasked with making a change just did their own thing to make it
work. Whatever it took; just to get the job done and get away from it. Each
block was in a different style, because there was no consistent style to comply
with. It was a nightmare. And getting worse.

<h2>2. Bugs</h2>

<p>Good layout conventions can highlight bugs. For example, look at this
declaration:

<pre><code class="java">enum Flags { BF, AF, GF, CF, FF, DF }
</code></pre>

You have to look quite hard to spot what is more obvious with this layout:

<pre><code class="java">enum Flags { AF, BF, CF, DF, FF, GF }
</code></pre>

And even more obvious with this layout:

<pre><code class="java">enum Flags { 
    AF,
    BF,
    CF,
    DF,
    FF,
    GF
}
</code></pre>

Namely that there is no "EF" flag. So even though you could say that the
order of items in an enum does not matter, simply putting them in alphabetical
order gives clear benefits.

<p>Obvious? I'm always surprised and a bit disappointed when people add a new
item to the end of a previously alphabetic list. And occassionally someone
will add an item at a random position in the middle of an alphabetic list...

<p>Also, look at this:

<pre><code class="java">xDimension = 1; xDimension = 2; zDimension = 3;
</code></pre>

Versus this:

<pre><code class="java">xDimension = 1;
xDimension = 2;
zDimension = 3;
</code></pre>

Where we are setting "xDimension" twice instead of setting "yDimension".

<p>So the key point is "think about the layout". What best exposes the
intended patterns to readers of the code?

<h2>3. Readability</h2>

<p>The bug visibility above is a product of good readability. In languages
where white-space is not significant, you have plenty of scope for aiding
readability by good use of spacing.

<p>Aligning similar things helps readability:

<pre><code class="java">public TypeZ descriptiveMethodName(TypeA aValue,
                                   TypeB bValue,
                                   TypeC cValue,
                                   TypeD dValue) {
                                   
  return new TypeZ(combine(aValue, bValue),
                   combine(cValue, dValue));
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use blank lines to group related lines of code. Just as short
paragraphs in text are easier to read than large blocks with no breaks. For
example:

<pre><code class="java">int x = 5;
int y = 4;

int sum = x + y;
int difference = x - y;

verify(x * x - y * y, sum * difference);
</code></pre>

<p>And of course you should choose good names for things. Unfortunately, as
Leon Bambrick said, "There are two hard problems in computer science: cache
invalidation, naming things and off-by-1 errors."

<p>So naming things will get a whole article later in this series. For now
lets just acknowledge that naming is hard. Especially when working in a team
that does not have a common first language; and when you have to use a number
of external libraries with inconsistent naming schemes.

<p>One thing specifically that I see often is contraction of names that
keeps the less useful information. For example:

<pre><code class="java">Shape sqShape = new Square(2);
Shape trShape = new Triangle(3, 4, 5);
</code></pre>

<p>And needless redundancy...

<pre><code class="java">@Test
public void testForTriangles()
</code></pre>

<p>And ... no, naming really is a whole article. Think hard about naming
and talk to your team. Do not be afraid to say in a review "I think this
would be better called X". Discuss it. Come to an understanding as a group
about what makes a good name for you.

<h2>4. Comments</h2>

<p>Sometimes code is hard to understand because it does something unexpected.
For example, in the "Bugs" section above we noticed that a declaration had
a sequence A, B, C, D, F, G and we surmised that there was a missing E.

<p>But what if the E was left out deliberately? This is exactly the place
to use a comment.

<pre><code class="java">// There is no EF flag because the Earth is not flat.
enum Flags { AF, BF, CF, DF, FF, GF }
</code></pre>

<p>Comments explain <em>why</em> the code is doing something, not <em>what</em>
it is doing. The code itself describes exactly what it is doing, there is no
need to comment that.

<p>Try to pre-empt questions that a reviewer might have about the code. Look
for things that you might think were suspicious in someone else's code and
explain why there is not a problem.

<pre><code class="c++">a.b.c.d(66);    // none of the intermediates can be NULL

// The last parameter must be NULL or we all die instantly.
setSelfDestruct(ALL, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>If there is more work required on the code, a TODO comment which includes
the ticket number for that work is really useful. Because without that a TODO
is basically an excuse for putting something off indefinitely.

<pre><code class="c++">int WWW_END_TIME = 32111;    // TODO : XYZ-666 is this right?
</code></pre>

<p>When it comes to objects, a comment explaining why it exists is
an explanation of what the object represents, not how it works.

<pre><code class="java">/**
 * Representation of a complex number (x + iy)
 * where i=sqrt(-1) and x,y are floating point numbers.
 */
public class Complex
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, bear in mind that short comments are often extracted by tools to
create documention. Going back to the ugly code at the start of this article,
the comment looks harmless if redundant in the context of the code. But extract
it out into documentation and you get this:

<pre><code class="doc">NumberAdder : this class adds numbers
</code></pre>

Which looks quite ridiculous and not at all helpful. Compared to

<pre><code class="doc">NumberAdder : An immutable sum of two integers
</code></pre>

Which describes exactly what it is.

<h2>5. IDE vs Review Tool</h2>

<p>Sometimes your code looks fine in the IDE but the reviewers comment that
the formatting is broken. Most commonly this is when the IDE does something
clever with mixtures of TAB characters and spaces. Or there is automatic line
wrapping or code folding.

<p>Be kind to the reviewers.

<p>When you create a pull-request always <em>check the layout</em> first
yourself.

<pre><code class="java">public int oops() {
    // all these lines
        errors += 3;
  // looked to be
    // indented by the same amount in the IDE
        return errors;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is a shame when you have gone to the trouble of laying out your code
properly and then make a bad impression on the reviewers because you do not
spot that you have mad combinations of hard TAB characters and spaces that
the review tool displays "weirdly".

<h2>6. Summary</h2>

<p>Beautiful code is important because it is

<ul>
<li>Easier to debug
<li>Easier to review
<li>Easier to maintain
</ul>

<p>Always write useful comments that explain why not how

<ul>
<li>Explain the non-obvious
<li>Can be extracted into external documentation
</ul>

<p>Time spent making your code beautiful is a good investment. Take note of
comments about style in reviews. Make comments about style in reviews. Do not
accept ugly code.
