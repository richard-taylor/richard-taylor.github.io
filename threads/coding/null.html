<h1 class="title">Null Safe Boundaries</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When you use languages that have uninitialised or <em>null</em> objects,
you have to be very careful not to use those objects like other objects.
Sometimes the compiler or runtime will help you with this... mostly it wont
and a program that has "worked fine until now" will just fail.

<p>For example, this Java code wont compile because the compiler knows that
you haven't even tried to initialise the name variable.

<pre><code class="java">String name;
boolean sir = name.startsWith("Sir");
</code></pre>

<p>But this will compile fine and will work unless getName returns null.

<pre><code class="java">String name = getName();
boolean sir = name.startsWith("Sir");
</code></pre>

<p>If that happens your program will throw a dreaded NullPointerException. And
you lose a chunk of your self-respect. Lets assume that getName is part of some
external library. You can complain that getName shouldn't ever return null, and
we will come to that later, but there are plenty of APIs that are documented as
returning null under some circumstances.

<h2>Dealing with null</h2>

<p>What you can do, when you get stung with a NullPointerException (NPE) is
to code round it. Like this:

<pre><code class="java">String name = getName();
boolean sir = (name == null) ? false : name.startsWith("Sir");
</code></pre>

<p>Which puts a little sticking plaster on that bit of code. But what if there
are other places where getName returns null that just haven't happened yet? Do
you wait and see? Or go looking for them?

<p>If you find yourself null-hunting like this then it is a sign that there are
problems with your code design. So how can we deal with this better?

<h2>Creating a null-safe boundary</h2>

<p>Instead of dealing with nulls one at a time you can create boundaries that
you know are safe and free from all nulls. One way is to use a class with a
constructor.

<pre><code class="java">public class Name {
    private final String name;

    public Name(String name) {
        this.name = (name == null) ? "" : name;
    }

    public boolean isSir() {
        return name.startsWith("Sir");
    }
}

Name name = new Name(getName());
boolean sir = name.isSir();
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can write code inside our Name class in the knowledge that there wont
ever be any NPE. Because the constructor leaves any nulls at the door. And we
can use the Name class without worrying that it might blow up somewhere one
day.

<p>But aren't we just hiding bugs inside a class here? Shouldn't the
constructor throw an IllegalArgumentException or something? No. That would
just be changing the exception type and wouldn't help us at all. It's not a
bug for getName to return null, that's just how it was designed by someone
else. It's only a bug for us to use the null object and trigger an NPE.

<p>By building a safe boundary we are saying "In this context we treat an
input of null as an empty Name."

<p>And we can extend our boundary by defining other classes which explicitly
define how they interpret a null input from other external sources.

<p>In this way we leave all the nulls at the boundary and can write code with
confidence that NPE will not strike.

<h2>Avoiding null in the first place</h2>

<p>Of course, it would be easier if getName just never returned null. So why
does it? Lets look at some of the situations where you might be tempted to use
null and see if there are alternatives.

<h3>1. Something went wrong</h3>

<p>A common reason for returning null is when the code fails to acquire the
data requested for some reason. Maybe it comes from a database or a REST
service that is temporarily unavailable. Internally it probably has code a bit
like this:

<pre><code class="java">public String getName() {
    String result = null;
    try {
        result = resource.getName();
    }
    catch (ResourceThingNotAvailableToday ex) {
        log.warn("Another failure: ", ex);
    }
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that there probably is a "name", but we can't
get it at this point in time. By returning null the code gives us an
opportunity to misinterpret the result as "there is no name". It would be
better to throw an exception; probably an application defined one, rather than
the raw exception from the underlying resource:

<pre><code class="java">public String getName() throws DatabaseError {
    try {
        return resource.getName();
    }
    catch (ResourceThingNotAvailableToday ex) {
        throw new DatabaseError(ex);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sure, your code now has to catch this and deal with it. And you could just
decide to treat the exception as "there is no name" still. But at least you
have the full picture and can do something else if possible.

<h3>2. There was no data</h3>

<p>Another possibility is that there really is no name for this thing. Maybe
the code looks like this:

<pre><code class="java">public String getName() {

    if (resource.hasName()) {
        return resource.getName();
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, it is really important to distinguish between a resource
where no name has been set and a resource where the name has been explicitly
set to "". Just as some people might care that my CV has no actual entry for
the number of Nobel Prizes I have won, rather than assuming that it is zero.

<p>There is almost always a sensible default value. In this case an empty
string looks like a good candidate:

<pre><code class="java">public static final String EMPTY_NAME = "";

public String getName() {

    if (resource.hasName()) {
        return resource.getName();
    } else {
        return EMPTY_NAME;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you really need to distinguish between <em>not set</em> and all other
values then consider using the <code>Optional</code> container introduced
in Java 8. The syntax is horrible IMHO but it does a job.

<p>And talking of containers; if you are returning a collection and have no
data then returning an empty list is almost certainly better than returning
null:

<pre><code class="java">public List&lt;String&gt; getNames() {

    if (resource.hasNames()) {
        return resource.getNames();
    } else {
        return Collections.emptyList();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, if you do find yourself using <code>Optional</code> a lot, then
ask yourself if your abstraction could be improved. One example I have seen
was a bit like this:

<pre><code class="java">public interface Computer {

    MotherBoard getMotherBoard();

    Optional&lt;SoundCard&gt; getSoundCard();
    Optional&lt;HardDrive&gt; getHardDrive();
    Optional&lt;GraphicsCard&gt; getGraphicsCard();
    Optional&lt;OpticalDrive&gt; getOpticalDrive();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the rationale was that all those Optionals were needed
because Computers always have a motherboard but may not have a soundcard etc.
and returning null was bad and returning some default was bad.

<p>This is putting a lot of burden on users of this interface to unpick what
the Computer is made of. Perhaps instead of having a getter for each type of
component the Computer <em>might</em> have, we provide a list of all the
components it <em>does</em> have:

<pre><code class="java">public interface Computer {

    List&lt;Component&gt; getComponents();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which, incidentally, gives us a nice obvious default Computer... one that
has an empty list of Components.

<h3>3. Laziness</h3>

<p>Have you ever seen Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) like this?

<pre><code class="java">public class Thing {

    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Normally these POJOs get constructed by a framework and "filled in" using
the "set" methods. But what if the setter is never called? You have a null
pointer inside your class. It's not much effort to add a constructor to
initialise all the fields.

<pre><code class="java">public class Thing {

    private String name;

    public Thing() {
        name = "";
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This gives us consistency with primitive types. Look at these two classes.
With proper initialisation both are valid as soon as they are constructed,
even though one contains only primitive types and the other classes. The user
of the objects shouldn't have to know what is inside.

<pre><code class="java">public class Complex {

    private float real;
    private float imaginary;

    // setters omitted

    public float getReal() {
        return real;
    }

    public float getImaginary() {
        return imaginary;
    }
}

public class ComplexPair {

    private Complex x;
    private Complex y;

    public ComplexPair() {
        x = new Complex();
        y = new Complex();
    }

    // setters omitted

    public Complex getX() {
        return x;
    }

    public Complex getY() {
        return y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Constructing an object should always put it into a valid useable state.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Null is bad. Avoid creating nulls in your own code by throwing exceptions
rather than hiding errors, using default values where appropriate and designing
objects that represent what <em>is</em> present rather than what <em>might
be</em> present.

<p>Externally generated nulls can be handled by creating boundaries
that leave the nulls outside. This liberates you to write code knowing
that you are in a null free space.
