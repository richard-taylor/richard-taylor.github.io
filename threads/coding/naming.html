<h1 class="title">A Rose By Any Other Name</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet" wrote Shakespeare. Sadly
code doesn't often smell as nice as roses...

<p>Consider this code snippet. What does it do?

<pre><code class="python">a = A(b())
c = C(d())

return c.e(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty much impossible to say, unless you have seen the definitions of
classes A and C and the methods b and d. The names are short, but they are
not descriptive in any way. Try this version instead.

<pre><code class="python">report = Report(today())
formatter = Formatter(style())

return formatter.format(report)
</code></pre>

<p>The code is identical apart from the names. Now we can at least tell that
some sort of report is being created for the current date and
formatted in a locally defined style.

<p>What is the report about, though? Is it a daily or monthly report?
And what is the formatted output? Try yet another version.

<pre><code class="python">report = GlobalServicesMonthlyUtilisationReport(todaysDate())
formatter = SummarisedTabularUtilisationReportFormatter(utilisationReportStyle())

return formatter.formatReportAsPDF(report)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we know a lot about what is going on... but the code is hard to read.

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>The problem with naming things, is that you need names that are short
enough to be readable, and long enough to be descriptive.

<p>As we saw in the introduction, some names are obviously too short and
some names are obviously too long. But where is the happy medium? We need
to compress information into a shortish name. How much can we throw away?

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>The context in which a name is used plays a big role in how much information
the name needs to retain. For example, in calculations using well known
formulae very short names can be appropriate.

<pre><code class="python">def total_energy():
    m = mass()
    v = speed()

    kinetic = 0.5 * m * v * v

    g = Constants.acceleration_due_to_gravity
    h = height()

    potential = m * g * h

    return kinetic + potential
</code></pre>

<p>In general short names only work if they have a very small scope (all the
uses are near the declaration) and if the name has a well understood meaning
from mathematical or other technical conventions.

<p>For this reason type names and function / method names need more information
because they are frequently used out of sight of their declaration.

<pre><code class="python">class ComplexNumber():

    def __init__(real, imaginary):
        self.real = real
        self.imaginary = imaginary

...

knownRoot = ComplexNumber(1.0, -1.0)
</code></pre>

<h2>Abbreviations</h2>

<p>Abbreviations are often a false economy, adding cognitive effort for the
reader whilst only shortening the code by a small amount. Some abbreviations
are almost universal, most are not.

<pre><code class="python">max = upper_no()        # number?
min = lower_number()    # yes!
</code></pre>

<p>Take care to only abbreviate what is less useful anyway. For example this
is just silly,

<pre><code class="java">Shape sqShape = new Square(2);
Shape trShape = new Triangle(3, 4, 5);
</code></pre>

<p>And compound abbreviations are illegal under the Geneva Conventions.

<pre><code class="java">int minNetBlkAddr = 666;
</code></pre>

<h2>Grammar</h2>

<p>Use the grammar of the English langauge where you can to capture the
functionality of the things you name. For example bland, lazy, names do
not give the reader much information,

<pre><code class="python">report = ReportUtils.getToday()
wrapped = ReportUtils.addEnvelope(report)
status = ReportUtils.send(wrapped)
</code></pre>

<p>Compared to,

<pre><code class="python">todaysReport = DailyReport()
todaysEmail = ReportEmail(todaysReport)
sentOK = Emailer.send(todaysEmail)
</code></pre>

<p>A reader should be able to tell immediately from a name whether it
represents a <b>thing</b>, an <b>action</b> or a <b>relationship</b>.

<pre><code class="python">Customer()   # thing
Buy()        # action
Buyer()      # thing
Connect()    # action
Connector()  # thing
Connection() # relationship
</code></pre>

<h2>Redundancy</h2>

<p>Most languages and/or programming environments make type-tagging of
variables redundant these days. It used to be common to see code like,

<pre><code class="python">costInt = 7
msgString = "Help! I am lost."
</code></pre>

<p>But usually as either global variables or in very long function definitions.
If you need to add the type to a variable name then you probably ought to
refactor your code instead. Unless the type of the variable is not obvious, or
even counterintuitive. In the following example adding "String" to the name
makes it clear that the delegate methods take a string parameter not a state
parameter.

<pre><code class="python">currentState = getState(now())
check(currentState)

currentStateString = str(currentState)
delegate.metrics(currentStateString)
delegate.logging(currentStateString)
</code></pre>

<p>There is also no need to repeat yourself if the language or framework
marks the function of something for you. This method is obviously a test,
so there is no need to call it "testSomething".

<pre><code class="java">@Test
public void testSomething()
</code></pre>

<h2>Camels and Snakes</h2>

<p>I am not going to advocate for CamelCaseNames or snake_case_names or
alllowercasenames or ALLUPPERCASENAMES. That is usually a matter for your
coding style to settle. But I will add a word of warning... always give a
moment's thought to how your names will read if they are transformed into
an alternative style.

<p>This is best illustrated with two real-world examples.

<ol>
    <li><b>Experts Exchange</b> was a perfectly good name until someone
        wrote it in all lowercase as "expertsexchange" and then for many
        people it was hard to not read it as "expert sex change".
    <li><b>Susan Album Party</b> was the title of an event tweeted about in
        2012 with the hashtag "#susanalbumparty" until someone spotted that
        it might be misread and changed it.
</ol>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

<p>Ah. The "C" word. You might wonder why I put this last. Surely it is an
easy guideline to state "use consistent names". And it is easy to state.
But it is really hard to do. Especially when working in a team that does
not have a common first language; and when you have to use a number of
external libraries with inconsistent naming schemes.

<p>It often helps to use the same terminology in your code as the business
running the code uses to define what it does. If the business deals with
customers then have a <code>Customer</code> object to represent that; don't
call it <code>Account</code> because that's what you think makes sense to
you as a programmer.

<p>Sometimes having a team without a common first language can help. Because
you are almost guaranteed to not all think the same names are "obvious" or
even "OK". That will either force you to discuss names during reviews (or
earlier, ideally) and you will come to agree on good names... or your team
will collapse in a heap of despair and you will all go your separate ways.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Naming things is hard. Especially if you think that it isn't and everyone
else just needs to try a bit harder to understand what you meant.

<p>Think hard about naming and talk to your team. Do not be afraid to say in
a review "I think this would be better called X". Discuss it. Come to an
understanding as a group (coders and business stakeholders) about what makes
a set of good names for you.
