<h1>Richard Taylor <a href="threads/contact.html">@</a></h1>
    
Barton. Southampton. Bath. Guildford.

<h2>Science and Engineering</h2>
    
<p>In 1992 I published my
<a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/361149/">PhD thesis</a> titled
"Colour Object Recognition Using Shape-based Aspects" at Southampton
University. I was a scientist! After a
post-doc at Bath University I found that full-time academic jobs were
really thin on the ground. Instead of hanging around in poorly paid
temporary positions, I went out into industry... never to return.

<p>See my <a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor">github projects</a>
or <a href="threads/index.html">read my threads</a> if you want to know
how much spare time I have had recently.

<h2>Rubik's Cube</h2>
    
<p>As the father of two speedcubers, I have been to many competitions
as a spectator and supporter. In 2015 I got bounced into competing but,
as you can see from my
<a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2015TAYL04">official cubing record</a>,
I wasn't very good. With some practise I have managed to get a bit faster
and recorded a 27.41 second solve at the Fontwell Open 2019.

<p>An official sub-30 average is my goal.
