  <h1>Richard Taylor <a id="anchor1">@</a></h1>
    
  Barton. Southampton. Bath. Guildford.

  <h2>Science and Engineering</h2>
    
  <p>In 1992 I published my
  <a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/361149/">PhD thesis</a> titled
  "Colour Object Recognition Using Shape-based Aspects" at Southampton
  University. I was a scientist! After a
  post-doc at Bath University I found that full-time academic jobs were
  really thin on the ground. Instead of hanging around in poorly paid
  temporary positions, I went out into industry... never to return.</p>

  <p>See my <a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor">github projects</a>
  if you want to know how much spare time I have had recently.</p>

  <h2>Rubik's Cube</h2>
    
  <p>As the father of two speedcubers, I have been to many competitions
  as a spectator and supporter. In 2015 I got bounced into competing but,
  as you can see from my
  <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2015TAYL04">official cubing record</a>,
  I wasn't very good. With some practise I have managed to get a bit faster
  and managed a 29.60 second solve at the Stratford-upon-Avon Open 2018.</p>

  <p>An official sub-30 average is my goal.</p>

  <h2>Eddie Shore</h2>
    
  <p>The 1930s ice-hockey player was originally the inspiration for my Quake
  handle; then later an influence on the lead character in two novels which I
  wrote in the early 2000s. The first was called
  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eddie-Shore-Moss-Call-Book-ebook/dp/B005MYLPTY">Eddie Shore and The Moss</a>
  and the sequel
  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eddie-Shore-Jo-Call-Book-ebook/dp/B005MYX2FO">Eddie Shore 4 Jo</a>.
  Both are now out of print, but still available as e-books for a reasonable
  price.</p>

  <p>A third novel may or may not be in progress...</p>

  <p>If you got this far looking for my email address then you either missed
  the <a id="anchor2">@ link</a> at the very top... or you have disabled
  JavaScript and it didn't turn into a mailto address.</p>
