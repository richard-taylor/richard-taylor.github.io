    <h1>Richard Taylor</h1>
    
    Barton. Southampton. Bath. Guildford.
    
    <h2>Science and Engineering</h2>
    
    <p>In 1992 I published my PhD thesis titled "Colour Object Recognition Using
    Shape-based Aspects" at Southampton University. I was a scientist! But
    academic jobs were thin on the ground. After a post-doc at Bath University
    I went out into industry... never to return.</p>

    <p>Since then I have gradually transitioned from a Computer Scientist into
    a Software Engineer. Most of my work is proprietary, but I try and support
    Open Source projects as much as possible and have a few
    <a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor">github projects</a>
    of my own.</p>

    <h2>Rubik's Cube</h2>
    
    <p>As the father of a proper speedcuber, I have been to several competitions
    as a spectator and supporter. Once I got bounced into competing but, as you
    can see from my <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2015TAYL04">official cubing record</a>,
    I wasn't very good. Currently I am in training; hoping for a sub-60 average
    in my next competition (possibly UK National Championships 2016).</p>

    <h2>Eddie Shore</h2>
    
    <p>Namesake of the iconic ice-hockey player, I wrote two novels about Eddie
    set in the early 2000s. The first was called
    <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1411696069">Eddie Shore and The Moss</a>
    and the sequel
    <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1411696077">Eddie Shore 4 Jo</a>.
    Both are now out of print, but still available as e-books for a reasonable
    price.</a>

    <p>Apparently "the novel is dead" now, so Eddie has started writing
    <a href="http://eddie-shore.blogspot.co.uk/">his blog</a> instead.
