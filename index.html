    Barton. Southampton. Bath. Guildford.
    
    <h2>Science and Engineering</h2>
    
    <p>In 1992 I published my PhD thesis titled "Colour Object Recognition Using
    Shape-based Aspects" at Southampton University. I was a scientist! After a
    post-doc at Bath University I found that full-time academic jobs were
    really thin on the ground. Instead of hanging around in poorly paid
    temporary positions, I went out into industry... never to return.</p>

    <p>See my <a href="https://github.com/richard-taylor">github projects</a>
    if you want to know how much spare time I have had recently.</p>

    <h2>Rubik's Cube</h2>
    
    <p>As the father of a proper speedcuber, I have been to many competitions
    as a spectator and supporter. In 2015 I got bounced into competing but,
    as you can see from my
    <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2015TAYL04">official cubing record</a>,
    I wasn't very good. With some practise I have managed to get a bit faster
    and managed a 30.66 second solve at the High Wycombe Open 2018.</p>

    <h2>Eddie Shore</h2>
    
    <p>The 1930s ice-hockey player was originally the inspiration for my Quake
    handle; then later an influence on the lead character in two novels which I
    wrote in the early 2000s. The first was called
    <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eddie-Shore-Moss-Call-Book-ebook/dp/B005MYLPTY">Eddie Shore and The Moss</a>
    and the sequel
    <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eddie-Shore-Jo-Call-Book-ebook/dp/B005MYX2FO">Eddie Shore 4 Jo</a>.
    Both are now out of print, but still available as e-books for a reasonable
    price.</p>

    <p>A third, as yet untitled, novel may or may not be in progress...</p>
