<h1>Notes for EOLine Solving</h1>

by <a href="index.html">Richard Taylor</a>

    
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The ZZ method for solving a Rubik's Cube has a first step called
<i>EOLine</i>, where edges are oriented and a line is made across the
bottom face. After this step the cube can be solved with only R, U and L
turns. This can be very fast, especially for one-handed solving.</p>

<p>Check out Conrad Rider's excellent
<a href="http://cube.crider.co.uk/zz.php">tutorial</a> to get you started.</a>

<p>Which is great. Except that EOLine is hard. Which means that most people
start by solving edge orientation (EO) first and then solving the line as
a second step.</p>

<p>As you get more experienced you want to start solving EO and the Line in
one step. But that can be a big leap to make; because you have to stop thinking
of just <i>good</i> and <i>bad</i> edges and realise that the 2 line edge
pieces are special.</p>

<p>This page is a collection of examples that helped me improve my EOLine. If
I get time I will also make some YouTube videos to match.</p>

<p>I scramble with yellow on the top and green on the front.</p>

<h2>Simple 4 bad edge case</h2>

<p>This example shows that the most obvious edge orientation moves can
sometimes place the line nicely. There are 4 bad edges; one line edge is
good, the other is bad.</p> 

<p>scramble: 
<span>U B2 D2 B U2 F U2 L' B2 L2 F D2 F' U2 R2 F' R2 D2 F' U'</span></p>

<p>eoline: <span>U  R' L' F D2</span></p>

<p>The <span>U R'</span> puts the red-green and blue-white bad edges onto the
front face without disturbing the good green-white edge. The <span>L'</span>
places the red-yellow bad edge on the front face; and the <span>F</span> then
makes all 4 bad edges good. Finally the <span>D2</span> puts the line the
right way round.</p>

<p>Things to note here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Putting a bad line edge into the FL or FR position allows it to be
oriented and placed into the line with one turn.</li>
<li>If it is easier to place the line edges on the opposite face to where
they end up, then go for it, because you only need one <span>D2</span> to
swap them at the end.</li>
<li>This is not the only way... <span>D2 U' L' R' B</span> is the same number
of turns but maybe a bit slower to execute.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Simple 6 bad edge case</h2>

<p>6 bad edges is the most likely case. In this example both line edges are
good but placed on the same face.</p>

<p>scramble:
<span>B2 U R2 U2 L' B' D2 R' F L U F2 L2 U L2 U L2 U L2 U2 R2</span></p>

<p>eoline: <span>F L F2 D' L2 F D'</span></p>

<p>Since there are 3 bad edges conveniently on the front face, we can start
with an <span>F</span> to leave us with 4 bad edges. Then <span>L F2 D'</span>
simultaneously places all the bad edges on the front face <i>and</i> places
the 2 line edges opposite each other. Leaving just <span>F</span> or
<span>F'</span> to fix the edges and <span>D'</span> to swing the line into
place.</p>

<p>Things to note here:</p>

<ol>
<li>If line edges are already good then you probably have to place them into
the DL and DR slots, because they will get in the way on the front and back
faces.</li>
<li>You can use <span>F2</span> to move edges between the left and right side
of the cube and the top and bottom, without changing any edge orientation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Hard 6 bad edge case</h2>

<p>Normally with 6 bad edges you would either fix 4 + 2, or 3 + 3. But
sometimes it might be better to add 2 bad edges and then fix 4 + 4. It sounds
mad; but when you are trying to place the line at the same time it can work
out nicely.</p>

<p>scramble:
<span>F' U2 B D2 B L2 F' D2 F' R2 D2 U R F' L F2 D' B' D' R' U</span></p>

<p>eoline: <span>F B2 R F B U' F2</span></p>

<p>This is hard to spot quickly. Especially since <span>B'</span> looks
like a good start.</p>
